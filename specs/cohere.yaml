    The Cohere Platform is centered around models.

    Each model has a different amount of power (i.e. parameters), to be used for different tasks.

    Cohere also supports finetuning of baseline models to improve performance on downstream tasks or to teach the model large quantities of information which cannot be extracted with few-shot learning or prompt engineering.

                    What is Isaac Newton most famous for?


                    Although Isaac Newton is well known for his discoveries in
                    optics (white light composition) and mathematics (calculus),
                    it is his formulation of the three laws of motion—the basic
                    principles of modern physics—for which he is most famous.
                    His formulation of the laws of motion resulted in the law of
                    universal gravitation.


                    How was Isaac Newton educated?


                    After interrupted attendance at the grammar school in
                    Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, Isaac Newton finally
                    settled down to prepare for university, going on to Trinity
                    College, Cambridge, in 1661, somewhat older than his
                    classmates. There he immersed himself in Aristotle’s work
                    and discovered the works of René Descartes before graduating
                    in 1665 with a bachelor’s degree.


                    What was Isaac Newton’s childhood like?


                    Isaac Newton was born to a widowed mother (his father died
                    three months prior) and was not expected to survive, being
                    tiny and weak. Shortly thereafter Newton was sent by his
                    stepfather, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, to live
                    with his grandmother and was separated from his mother until
                    Smith’s death in 1653.


                    What did Isaac Newton write?


                    Isaac Newton is widely known for his published work
                    Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687),
                    commonly known as the Principia. His laws of motion first
                    appeared in this work. It is one of the most important
                    single works in the history of modern science.

                    Isaac Newton (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New
                    Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England—died March 20
                    [March 31], 1727, London) was an English physicist and
                    mathematician who was the culminating figure of the
                    Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, his
                    discovery of the composition of white light integrated the
                    phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the
                    foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his
                    three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern
                    physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal
                    gravitation. In mathematics, he was the original discoverer
                    of the infinitesimal calculus. Newton’s Philosophiae
                    Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of
                    Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important
                    single works in the history of modern science.


                    Formative influences


                    Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton was the only son
                    of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three
                    months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at
                    Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died; Newton
                    would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science
                    of motion and bring his work to full fruition. A tiny and
                    weak baby, Newton was not expected to survive his first day
                    of life, much less 84 years. Deprived of a father before
                    birth, he soon lost his mother as well, for within two years
                    she married a second time; her husband, the well-to-do
                    minister Barnabas Smith, left young Isaac with his
                    grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a
                    son and two daughters. For nine years, until the death of
                    Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from
                    his mother, and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have
                    been ascribed to this traumatic event. That he hated his
                    stepfather we may be sure. When he examined the state of his
                    soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand, he
                    remembered “Threatning my father and mother Smith to burne
                    them and the house over them.” The acute sense of insecurity
                    that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was
                    published and irrationally violent when he defended it
                    accompanied Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be
                    traced to his early years.


                    After his mother was widowed a second time, she determined
                    that her first-born son should manage her now considerable
                    property. It quickly became apparent, however, that this
                    would be a disaster, both for the estate and for Newton. He
                    could not bring himself to concentrate on rural affairs—set
                    to watch the cattle, he would curl up under a tree with a
                    book. Fortunately, the mistake was recognized, and Newton
                    was sent back to the grammar school in Grantham, where he
                    had already studied, to prepare for the university. As with
                    many of the leading scientists of the age, he left behind in
                    Grantham anecdotes about his mechanical ability and his
                    skill in building models of machines, such as clocks and
                    windmills. At the school he apparently gained a firm command
                    of Latin but probably received no more than a smattering of
                    arithmetic. By June 1661 he was ready to matriculate at
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, somewhat older than the other
                    undergraduates because of his interrupted education.


                    Influence of the Scientific Revolution


                    When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now
                    known as the Scientific Revolution was well advanced, and
                    many of the works basic to modern science had appeared.
                    Astronomers from Nicolaus Copernicus to Johannes Kepler had
                    elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe. Galileo
                    had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the
                    principle of inertia. Led by René Descartes, philosophers
                    had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an
                    intricate, impersonal, and inert machine. Yet as far as the
                    universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned,
                    all this might well have never happened. They continued to
                    be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested
                    on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature
                    in qualitative rather than quantitative terms.


                    Physics and Natural Law


                    Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his
                    higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle’s work.
                    Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, it
                    was in the air. Some time during his undergraduate career,
                    Newton discovered the works of the French natural
                    philosopher Descartes and the other mechanical philosophers,
                    who, in contrast to Aristotle, viewed physical reality as
                    composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and who
                    held that all the phenomena of nature result from their
                    mechanical interaction. A new set of notes, which he
                    entitled “Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae” (“Certain
                    Philosophical Questions”), begun sometime in 1664, usurped
                    the unused pages of a notebook intended for traditional
                    scholastic exercises; under the title he entered the slogan
                    “Amicus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis amica veritas”
                    (“Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my best
                    friend is truth”). Newton’s scientific career had begun.


                    The “Quaestiones” reveal that Newton had discovered the new
                    conception of nature that provided the framework of the
                    Scientific Revolution. He had thoroughly mastered the works
                    of Descartes and had also discovered that the French
                    philosopher Pierre Gassendi had revived atomism, an
                    alternative mechanical system to explain nature. The
                    “Quaestiones” also reveal that Newton already was inclined
                    to find the latter a more attractive philosophy than
                    Cartesian natural philosophy, which rejected the existence
                    of ultimate indivisible particles. The works of the
                    17th-century chemist Robert Boyle provided the foundation
                    for Newton’s considerable work in chemistry. Significantly,
                    he had read Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, and was
                    thereby introduced to another intellectual world, the
                    magical Hermetic tradition, which sought to explain natural
                    phenomena in terms of alchemical and magical concepts. The
                    two traditions of natural philosophy, the mechanical and the
                    Hermetic, antithetical though they appear, continued to
                    influence his thought and in their tension supplied the
                    fundamental theme of his scientific career.

                    Although he did not record it in the “Quaestiones,” Newton
                    had also begun his mathematical studies. He again started
                    with Descartes, from whose La Géometrie he branched out into
                    the other literature of modern analysis with its application
                    of algebraic techniques to problems of geometry. He then
                    reached back for the support of classical geometry. Within
                    little more than a year, he had mastered the literature;
                    and, pursuing his own line of analysis, he began to move
                    into new territory. He discovered the binomial theorem, and
                    he developed the calculus, a more powerful form of analysis
                    that employs infinitesimal considerations in finding the
                    slopes of curves and areas under curves.


                    By 1669 Newton was ready to write a tract summarizing his
                    progress, De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum
                    Infinitas (“On Analysis by Infinite Series”), which
                    circulated in manuscript through a limited circle and made
                    his name known. During the next two years he revised it as
                    De methodis serierum et fluxionum (“On the Methods of Series
                    and Fluxions”). The word fluxions, Newton’s private rubric,
                    indicates that the calculus had been born. Despite the fact
                    that only a handful of savants were even aware of Newton’s
                    existence, he had arrived at the point where he had become
                    the leading mathematician in Europe.


                    Work during the plague years


                    Who created the color wheel?


                    For millennia, many believed Aristotle's theory that all
                    colors were a mixture of black and white. How did we learn
                    otherwise?(more)See all videos for this article


                    When Newton received the bachelor’s degree in April 1665,
                    the most remarkable undergraduate career in the history of
                    university education had passed unrecognized. On his own,
                    without formal guidance, he had sought out the new
                    philosophy and the new mathematics and made them his own,
                    but he had confined the progress of his studies to his
                    notebooks. Then, in 1665, the plague closed the university,
                    and for most of the following two years he was forced to
                    stay at his home, contemplating at leisure what he had
                    learned. During the plague years Newton laid the foundations
                    of the calculus and extended an earlier insight into an
                    essay, “Of Colours,” which contains most of the ideas
                    elaborated in his Opticks. It was during this time that he
                    examined the elements of circular motion and, applying his
                    analysis to the Moon and the planets, derived the inverse
                    square relation that the radially directed force acting on a
                    planet decreases with the square of its distance from the
                    Sun—which was later crucial to the law of universal
                    gravitation. The world heard nothing of these discoveries.

                    Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27)
                    was an English polymath active as a mathematician,
                    physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who
                    was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a
                    key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the
                    Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophiæ
                    Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of
                    Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated
                    many previous results and established classical mechanics.
                    Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares
                    credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
                    for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed
                    calculus years before Leibniz.


                    In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and
                    universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific
                    viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the
                    theory of relativity. He used his mathematical description
                    of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion,
                    account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the
                    precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating
                    doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He
                    demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and
                    celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same
                    principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate
                    spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of
                    Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most
                    European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian
                    mechanics over earlier systems.


                    He built the first practical reflecting telescope and
                    developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the
                    observation that a prism separates white light into the
                    colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was
                    collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published
                    in 1704. He formulated an empirical law of cooling, which
                    was the first heat transfer formulation, made the first
                    theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and
                    introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. Furthermore, he
                    made early investigations into electricity, with an idea
                    from his book Opticks arguably the beginning of the field
                    theory of the electric force. In addition to his work on
                    calculus, as a mathematician, he contributed to the study of
                    power series, generalised the binomial theorem to
                    non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating
                    the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic
                    plane curves.


                    Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second
                    Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of
                    Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who
                    privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. He refused
                    to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most
                    members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work
                    on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his
                    time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but
                    most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until
                    long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the
                    Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of
                    Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–1690 and
                    1701–1702. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent
                    the last three decades of his life in London, serving as
                    Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint,
                    as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).


                    Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in
                    use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December
                    1642 (NS 4 January 1643) at Woolsthorpe Manor in
                    Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of
                    Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died
                    three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small
                    child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he
                    could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three,
                    his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband,
                    the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of
                    his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe).
                    Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity
                    towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this
                    entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19:
                    "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the
                    house over them." Newton's mother had three children (Mary,
                    Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.


                    From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton
                    was educated at The King's School in Grantham, which taught
                    Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant
                    foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school by his
                    mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by
                    October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time,
                    attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.
                    Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his
                    mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a
                    desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the
                    top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by
                    building sundials and models of windmills.


                    University of Cambridge


                    In June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College at the
                    University of Cambridge. His uncle the Reverend William
                    Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to
                    the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a subsizar,
                    paying his way by performing valet duties until he was
                    awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university
                    costs for four more years until the completion of his MA. At
                    the time, Cambridge's teachings were based on those of
                    Aristotle, whom Newton read along with then more modern
                    philosophers, including Descartes and astronomers such as
                    Galileo Galilei and Thomas Street. He set down in his
                    notebook a series of "Quaestiones" about mechanical
                    philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the
                    generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a
                    mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after
                    Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665,
                    the university temporarily closed as a precaution against
                    the Great Plague.


                    Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,
                    Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the
                    next two years saw the development of his theories on
                    calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.


                    In April 1667, Newton returned to the University of
                    Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of
                    Trinity. Fellows were required to take holy orders and be
                    ordained as Anglican priests, although this was not enforced
                    in the Restoration years, and an assertion of conformity to
                    the Church of England was sufficient. He made the commitment
                    that "I will either set Theology as the object of my studies
                    and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these
                    statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the
                    college." Up until this point he had not thought much about
                    religion and had twice signed his agreement to the
                    Thirty-nine Articles, the basis of Church of England
                    doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by
                    then his unconventional views stood in the way.


                    His academic work impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac
                    Barrow, who was anxious to develop his own religious and
                    administrative potential (he became master of Trinity
                    College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him,
                    only one year after receiving his MA. The terms of the
                    Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be
                    active in the church – presumably to leave more time for
                    science. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the
                    ordination requirement, and King Charles II, whose
                    permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a
                    conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican
                    orthodoxy was averted.


                    The Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge position
                    included the responsibility of instructing geography. In
                    1672, and again in 1681, Newton published a revised,
                    corrected, and amended edition of the Geographia Generalis,
                    a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the
                    then-deceased Bernhardus Varenius. In the Geographia
                    Generalis, Varenius attempted to create a theoretical
                    foundation linking scientific principles to classical
                    concepts in geography, and considered geography to be a mix
                    between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying
                    features of the Earth. While it is unclear if Newton ever
                    lectured in geography, the 1733 Dugdale and Shaw English
                    translation of the book stated Newton published the book to
                    be read by students while he lectured on the subject. The
                    Geographia Generalis is viewed by some as the dividing line
                    between ancient and modern traditions in the history of
                    geography, and Newton's involvement in the subsequent
                    editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for
                    this enduring legacy.


                    Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in
                    1672.


                    Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every
                    branch of mathematics then studied". His work on the
                    subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen
                    in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among
                    Newton's mathematical papers. His work De analysi per
                    aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac
                    Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by
                    Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work
                    "of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these
                    things". Newton later became involved in a dispute with
                    Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus. Most
                    modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed
                    calculus independently, although with very different
                    mathematical notations. However, it is established that
                    Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.
                    Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays
                    recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted
                    by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or
                    so, also by British mathematicians.


                    His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based
                    on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small
                    quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave
                    demonstration of this under the name of "the method of first
                    and last ratios" and explained why he put his expositions in
                    this form, remarking also that "hereby the same thing is
                    performed as by the method of indivisibles." Because of
                    this, the Principia has been called "a book dense with the
                    theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus" in
                    modern times and in Newton's time "nearly all of it is of
                    this calculus." His use of methods involving "one or more
                    orders of the infinitesimally small" is present in his De
                    motu corporum in gyrum of 1684 and in his papers on motion
                    "during the two decades preceding 1684".


                    Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he
                    feared controversy and criticism. He was close to the Swiss
                    mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier
                    started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and
                    corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between
                    Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never
                    completed. Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal
                    Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then
                    broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society
                    proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true
                    discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found
                    that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.
                    Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of
                    both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.


                    Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial
                    theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's
                    identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves
                    (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made
                    substantial contributions to the theory of finite
                    differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and
                    to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to
                    Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the
                    harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's
                    summation formula) and was the first to use power series
                    with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on
                    infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.


                    In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours
                    exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is
                    oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is
                    circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different
                    colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that
                    colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had,
                    until then, been a matter of debate.


                    From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this
                    period he investigated the refraction of light,
                    demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a
                    prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into
                    white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship
                    has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white
                    light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.


                    He showed that coloured light does not change its properties
                    by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various
                    objects, and that regardless of whether reflected,
                    scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same
                    colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of
                    objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than
                    objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as
                    Newton's theory of colour.


                    From this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting
                    telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into
                    colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept,
                    he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead
                    of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building
                    the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope,
                    today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the
                    problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.
                    Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of
                    highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to
                    judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. In late
                    1668, he was able to produce this first reflecting
                    telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a
                    clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked
                    for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their
                    interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours,
                    which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert
                    Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so
                    offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and
                    Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed
                    to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a
                    correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton
                    to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of
                    stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical
                    form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal
                    force inversely proportional to the square of the radius
                    vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms
                    until Hooke's death.


                    Newton argued that light is composed of particles or
                    corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a
                    denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the
                    repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin
                    films (Opticks Bk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his
                    theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or
                    transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a
                    purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the
                    interference patterns and the general phenomenon of
                    diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the
                    idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance
                    to Newton's understanding of light.


                    In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the
                    existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles.
                    The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry
                    More revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether
                    with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and
                    repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who
                    acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that
                    "Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the
                    last of the magicians." Newton's contributions to science
                    cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy. This was at
                    a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy
                    and science.


                    In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his
                    corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made
                    up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was
                    made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a
                    kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and
                    Light convertible into one another, ... and may not Bodies
                    receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light
                    which enter their Composition?" Newton also constructed a
                    primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator,
                    using a glass globe.


                    In his book Opticks, Newton was the first to show a diagram
                    using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of
                    multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton's
                    discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to
                    the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. Also,
                    the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the
                    multiple-prism dispersion theory.


                    Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Young and
                    Fresnel discarded Newton's particle theory in favour of
                    Huygens' wave theory to show that colour is the visible
                    manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly
                    came to realise the difference between perception of colour
                    and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist,
                    Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but "one
                    hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour, ... Newton had
                    committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without
                    colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the
                    object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect,
                    achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This
                    inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong."


                    Newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far
                    back as 1665. In 1679, Newton returned to his work on
                    celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its
                    effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's
                    laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a
                    brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had
                    been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society, and who
                    opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions
                    from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's
                    reawakening interest in astronomical matters received
                    further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter
                    of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.
                    After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof
                    that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result
                    from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the
                    square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results
                    to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu
                    corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets
                    which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in
                    December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton
                    developed and expanded to form the Principia.


                    The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with
                    encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work,
                    Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together,
                    these laws describe the relationship between any object, the
                    forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the
                    foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many
                    advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon
                    followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years.
                    Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of
                    non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used
                    the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would
                    become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal
                    gravitation.


                    In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of
                    geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the
                    first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) of the
                    speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's
                    spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the
                    equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction
                    on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study
                    of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a
                    theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and
                    much more. Newton's biographer David Brewster reported that
                    the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the
                    motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton's health:
                    "[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep" during his
                    work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer John
                    Machin that "his head never ached but when he was studying
                    the subject". According to Brewster, Edmund Halley also told
                    John Conduitt that when pressed to complete his analysis
                    Newton "always replied that it made his head ache, and kept
                    him awake so often, that he would think of it no more".
                    [Emphasis in original]


                    Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar
                    System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in
                    the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from
                    the centre of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton, it
                    was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body
                    that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common
                    centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets
                    is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre
                    of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in
                    a right line". (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in
                    view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was
                    at rest.)


                    Newton was criticised for introducing "occult agencies" into
                    science because of his postulate of an invisible force able
                    to act over vast distances. Later, in the second edition of
                    the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms
                    in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough
                    that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as
                    they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it
                    was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of
                    things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton
                    used what became his famous expression "Hypotheses non
                    fingo".)


                    With the Principia, Newton became internationally
                    recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the
                    Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.


                    In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 "species" of cubic curves
                    and categorised them into four types. In 1717, and probably
                    with Newton's help, James Stirling proved that every cubic
                    was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the
                    four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of
                    them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his
                    death.


                    In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts
                    dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the
                    Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he
                    disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and
                    its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New
                    Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.


                    Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for
                    Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some
                    accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold
                    draught in the chamber and request that the window be
                    closed. He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham
                    de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening
                    locals by claiming that a house was haunted.


                    Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the
                    Royal Mint during the reign of King William III in 1696, a
                    position that he had obtained through the patronage of
                    Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the
                    Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, trod
                    on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and
                    secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary
                    Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the
                    best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale
                    in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his
                    life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but
                    Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge
                    duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the
                    currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.


                    As Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint,
                    Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in
                    during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit.
                    Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon
                    being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting
                    even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely
                    difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.


                    Disguised as a habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much
                    of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to
                    prosecution, and separating the branches of government,
                    English law still had ancient and formidable customs of
                    authority. Newton had himself made a justice of the peace in
                    all the home counties. A draft letter regarding the matter
                    is included in Newton's personal first edition of
                    Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which he must
                    have been amending at the time. Then he conducted more than
                    100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects
                    between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully
                    prosecuted 28 coiners.


                    Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and
                    an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his
                    position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John
                    Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing
                    Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica, which Newton had
                    used in his studies.


                    In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal
                    visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is
                    likely to have been motivated by political considerations
                    connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705,
                    rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or
                    services as Master of the Mint. Newton was the second
                    scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon.


                    As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September
                    1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury,
                    the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver
                    coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717,
                    forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21
                    silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver
                    shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while
                    exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain
                    from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a
                    matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or
                    not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at
                    the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.


                    Newton was invested in the South Sea Company and lost some
                    £20,000 (£4.4 million in 2020) when it collapsed in around
                    1720.


                    Toward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at
                    Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with his niece and her
                    husband, until his death. His half-niece, Catherine Barton,
                    served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on
                    Jermyn Street in London; he was her "very loving Uncle",
                    according to his letter to her when she was recovering from
                    smallpox.


                    Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20
                    March 1726; NS 31 March 1727). He was given a ceremonial
                    funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers,
                    and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens.
                    He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey.
                    Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor,
                    he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his
                    last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John
                    Conduitt and Catherine Barton.


                    Shortly after his death, a plaster death mask was moulded of
                    Newton. It was used by Flemish sculptor John Michael
                    Rysbrack in making a sculpture of Newton. It is now held by
                    the Royal Society, who created a 3D scan of it in 2012.


                    Newton's hair was posthumously examined and found to contain
                    mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits.
                    Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in
                    late life.


                    Although it was claimed that he was once engaged, Newton
                    never married. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire,
                    who was in London at the time of Newton's funeral, said that
                    he "was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to
                    the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with
                    women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician
                    and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.” There
                    exists a widespread belief that Newton died a virgin, and
                    writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton,
                    economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan have
                    commented on it.


                    Newton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician
                    Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around
                    1689—some of their correspondence has survived. Their
                    relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693,
                    and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown,
                    which included sending wild accusatory letters to his
                    friends Samuel Pepys and John Locke. His note to the latter
                    included the charge that Locke had endeavoured to "embroil"
                    him with "woemen & by other means".


                    Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing
                    in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, "If I have
                    seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
                    Two writers think that the sentence, written at a time when
                    Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries,
                    was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and
                    hunchbacked), rather than—or in addition to—a statement of
                    modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about
                    standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others
                    by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert (a former orator
                    of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity
                    College) in his Jacula Prudentum (1651), had as its main
                    point that "a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of
                    the two", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton
                    himself rather than Hooke as the 'dwarf'.


                    In a later memoir, Newton wrote, "I do not know what I may
                    appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only
                    like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in
                    now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
                    than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all
                    undiscovered before me."


                    Although born into an Anglican family, by his thirties
                    Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public,
                    would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream
                    Christianity, with one historian labelling him a heretic.


                    By 1672, he had started to record his theological researches
                    in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only
                    been available for public examination since 1972. Over half
                    of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and
                    most has never been printed. His writings demonstrate an
                    extensive knowledge of early Church writings and show that
                    in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined
                    the Creed, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who
                    rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton
                    "recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man,
                    who was subordinate to the Father who created him." He was
                    especially interested in prophecy, but for him, "the great
                    apostasy was trinitarianism."


                    Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two
                    fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination
                    requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a
                    dispensation from the government that excused him and all
                    future holders of the Lucasian chair.


                    In Newton's eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to
                    him the fundamental sin. In 1999, historian Stephen D.
                    Snobelen wrote, "Isaac Newton was a heretic. But ... he
                    never made a public declaration of his private faith—which
                    the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his
                    faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his
                    personal beliefs." Snobelen concludes that Newton was at
                    least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly
                    read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and
                    almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.


                    Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became
                    Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using
                    them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a
                    great clock. He said, "So then gravity may put the planets
                    into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put
                    them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the
                    sun".


                    Along with his scientific fame, Newton's studies of the
                    Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy.
                    Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An
                    Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture
                    and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the
                    Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus
                    Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one
                    traditionally accepted date.


                    He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected
                    the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The
                    ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be
                    understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In
                    his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the
                    Principia "I had an eye upon such Principles as might work
                    with considering men for the belief of a Deity". He saw
                    evidence of design in the system of the world: "Such a
                    wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed
                    the effect of choice". But Newton insisted that divine
                    intervention would eventually be required to reform the
                    system, due to the slow growth of instabilities. For this,
                    Leibniz lampooned him: "God Almighty wants to wind up his
                    watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move.
                    He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a
                    perpetual motion."


                    Newton's position was vigorously defended by his follower
                    Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later,
                    Pierre-Simon Laplace's work Celestial Mechanics had a
                    natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require
                    periodic divine intervention. The contrast between Laplace's
                    mechanistic worldview and Newton's one is the most strident
                    considering the famous answer which the French scientist
                    gave Napoleon, who had criticised him for the absence of the
                    Creator in the Mécanique céleste: "Sire, j'ai pu me passer
                    de cette hypothèse" ("Sir, I didn't need this hypothesis").


                    Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine
                    of the Trinity. His first biographer, David Brewster, who
                    compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning
                    the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity,
                    but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such. In
                    the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by
                    Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes (among others) were
                    deciphered and it became known that Newton did indeed reject
                    Trinitarianism.


                    Newton and Robert Boyle's approach to the mechanical
                    philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a
                    viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and
                    was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as
                    dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. The clarity
                    and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the
                    emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both
                    superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, and at
                    the same time, the second wave of English deists used
                    Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a
                    "Natural Religion".


                    The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment "magical
                    thinking", and the mystical elements of Christianity, were
                    given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of
                    the universe. Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion
                    through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly,
                    was very successful in popularising them.


                    Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the
                    last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and
                    Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the
                    visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those
                    who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less
                    than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born
                    with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last
                    wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and
                    appropriate homage.


                    –John Maynard Keynes, "Newton, the Man"


                    Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton's
                    papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of
                    Newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other
                    manuscripts, with his own annotations. Alchemical texts mix
                    artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often
                    hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to
                    protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in
                    Newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the
                    church.


                    In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloguing Newton's
                    papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and
                    returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a
                    descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's. The
                    collection was broken up and sold for a total of about
                    £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen
                    bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction.
                    Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton's
                    collection of papers on alchemy before donating his
                    collection to Cambridge University in 1946.


                    All of Newton's known writings on alchemy are currently
                    being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana
                    University: "The Chymistry of Isaac Newton" and summarised
                    in a book.


                    Newton's fundamental contributions to science include the
                    quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery
                    that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral
                    colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is
                    another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly
                    known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of
                    his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his
                    contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton's
                    involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often
                    called in seventeenth-century England, "chymistry."


                    In June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton's notes on Jan
                    Baptist van Helmont's book on plague, De Peste, were being
                    auctioned online by Bonhams. Newton's analysis of this book,
                    which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from
                    London's 1665–1666 infection, is the most substantial
                    written statement he is known to have made about the plague,
                    according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned,
                    Newton writes that "the best is a toad suspended by the legs
                    in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth
                    with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and
                    shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the
                    excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the
                    affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the
                    poison".


                    The mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange said that Newton was
                    the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that
                    Newton was also "the most fortunate, for we cannot find more
                    than once a system of the world to establish." English poet
                    Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:


                    Nature, and Nature's laws lay hid in night. God said, Let
                    Newton be! and all was light.


                    But this was not allowed to be inscribed in Newton's
                    monument at Westminster. The epitaph added is as follows:


                    H. S. E. ISAACUS NEWTON Eques Auratus, / Qui, animi vi prope
                    divinâ, / Planetarum Motus, Figuras, / Cometarum semitas,
                    Oceanique Aestus. Suâ Mathesi facem praeferente / Primus
                    demonstravit: / Radiorum Lucis dissimilitudines, /
                    Colorumque inde nascentium proprietates, / Quas nemo antea
                    vel suspicatus erat, pervestigavit. / Naturae, Antiquitatis,
                    S. Scripturae, / Sedulus, sagax, fidus Interpres / Dei O. M.

                    Moribus expressit. / Sibi gratulentur Mortales, / Tale
                    tantumque exstitisse / HUMANI GENERIS DECUS. / NAT. XXV DEC.
                    A.D. MDCXLII. OBIIT. XX. MAR. MDCCXXVI,


                    which can be translated as follows:


                    Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of
                    mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly
                    his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the
                    paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities
                    in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously
                    imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced.
                    Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of
                    nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by
                    his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and
                    expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.
                    Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an
                    ornament of the human race! He was born on 25th December
                    1642, and died on 20th March 1726.


                    In a 2005 survey of members of Britain's Royal Society
                    (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater
                    effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein,
                    the members deemed Newton to have made the greater overall
                    contribution. In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of the day's
                    leading physicists voted Einstein the "greatest physicist
                    ever," with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of
                    rank-and-file physicists by the site PhysicsWeb gave the top
                    spot to Newton. New Scientist called Newton "the supreme
                    genius and most enigmatic character in the history of
                    science". Newton has been called the "most influential
                    figure in the history of Western science". Einstein kept a
                    picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of
                    Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell.


                    Physicist Lev Landau ranked physicists on a logarithmic
                    scale of productivity ranging from 0 to 5. The highest
                    ranking, 0, was assigned to Newton. Albert Einstein was
                    ranked 0.5. A rank of 1 was awarded to the "founding
                    fathers" of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner
                    Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrödinger. Landau, a
                    Nobel prize winner and discoverer of superfluidity, ranked
                    himself as 2.


                    The SI derived unit of force is named the newton in his
                    honour.


                    Woolsthorpe Manor is a Grade I listed building by Historic
                    England through being his birthplace and "where he
                    discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the
                    refraction of light".


                    In 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold
                    for £730 in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a
                    ring. Guinness World Records 2002 classified it as the most
                    valuable tooth in the world, which would value approximately
                    £25,000 (US$35,700) in late 2001. Who bought it and who
                    currently has it has not been disclosed.


                    Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to
                    formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of
                    an apple from a tree. The story is believed to have passed
                    into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine
                    Barton, Newton's niece, to Voltaire. Voltaire then wrote in
                    his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), "Sir Isaac Newton walking
                    in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of
                    gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree."


                    Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and
                    that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any
                    single moment, acquaintances of Newton (such as William
                    Stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made
                    available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the
                    incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple
                    actually hit Newton's head. Stukeley recorded in his Memoirs
                    of Sir Isaac Newton's Life a conversation with Newton in
                    Kensington on 15 April 1726:


                    we went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of
                    some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse,
                    he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when
                    formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. "why
                    should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the
                    ground," thought he to him self: occasion'd by the fall of
                    an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: "why should it
                    not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths
                    centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it.
                    there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the
                    drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the
                    earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos
                    this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if
                    matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its
                    quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as
                    the earth draws the apple."


                    John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and
                    husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he
                    wrote about Newton's life:


                    In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his
                    mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering
                    in a garden it came into his thought that the power of
                    gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground)
                    was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that
                    this power must extend much further than was usually
                    thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if
                    so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in
                    her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the
                    effect of that supposition.


                    It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in
                    the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity
                    extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon;
                    however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged
                    theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but
                    whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be
                    the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that
                    if the force decreased as the inverse square of the
                    distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital
                    period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force
                    was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named
                    it "universal gravitation".


                    Various trees are claimed to be "the" apple tree which
                    Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham claims that
                    the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and
                    transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The
                    staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor
                    dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens
                    is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original
                    tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity
                    College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he
                    studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale in
                    Kent can supply grafts from their tree, which appears
                    identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking
                    variety.


                    Newton's monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey,
                    at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir
                    screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor
                    Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with
                    design by the architect William Kent. The monument features
                    a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his
                    right elbow resting on several of his great books and his
                    left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design.
                    Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the
                    signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A
                    relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a
                    telescope and prism.


                    From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry
                    Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the
                    Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank
                    of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes
                    holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a
                    map of the Solar System.


                    A statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet,
                    can be seen at the Oxford University Museum of Natural
                    History. A large bronze statue, Newton, after William Blake,
                    by Eduardo Paolozzi, dated 1995 and inspired by Blake's
                    etching, dominates the piazza of the British Library in
                    London. A bronze statue of Newton was erected in 1858 in the
                    centre of Grantham where he went to school, prominently
                    standing in front of Grantham Guildhall.


                    The still-surviving farmhouse at Woolsthorpe By Colsterworth
                    is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through
                    being his birthplace and "where he discovered gravity and
                    developed his theories regarding the refraction of light".


                    Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of
                    scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton
                    principally—as the guides and guarantors of their
                    applications of the singular concept of nature and natural
                    law to every physical and social field of the day. In this
                    respect, the lessons of history and the social structures
                    built upon it could be discarded.


                    It is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and
                    by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton's publication
                    of the Principia was a turning point in the Scientific
                    Revolution and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton's
                    conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally
                    understandable laws that became one of the seeds for
                    Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts
                    of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic
                    rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural
                    conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic
                    systems; and sociologists criticised the current social
                    order for trying to fit history into natural models of
                    progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of
                    Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform
                    with their strong religious views of nature.

                    ^ a b c d e During Newton's lifetime, two calendars were in
                    use in Europe: the Julian ("Old Style") calendar in
                    Protestant and Orthodox regions, including Britain; and the
                    Gregorian ("New Style") calendar in Roman Catholic Europe.
                    At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of
                    Julian dates; thus, his birth is recorded as taking place on
                    25 December 1642 Old Style, but it can be converted to a New
                    Style (modern) date of 4 January 1643. By the time of his
                    death, the difference between the calendars had increased to
                    eleven days. Moreover, he died in the period after the start
                    of the New Style year on 1 January but before that of the
                    Old Style new year on 25 March. His death occurred on 20
                    March 1726, according to the Old Style calendar, but the
                    year is usually adjusted to 1727. A full conversion to New
                    Style gives the date 31 March 1727.


                    ^ This claim was made by William Stukeley in 1727, in a
                    letter about Newton written to Richard Mead. Charles Hutton,
                    who in the late eighteenth century collected oral traditions
                    about earlier scientists, declared that there "do not appear
                    to be any sufficient reason for his never marrying, if he
                    had an inclination so to do. It is much more likely that he
                    had a constitutional indifference to the state, and even to
                    the sex in general."

                    First published Wed Dec 19, 2007


                    Isaac Newton (1642–1727) is best known for having invented
                    the calculus in the mid to late 1660s (most of a decade
                    before Leibniz did so independently, and ultimately more
                    influentially) and for having formulated the theory of
                    universal gravity — the latter in his Principia, the single
                    most important work in the transformation of early modern
                    natural philosophy into modern physical science. Yet he also
                    made major discoveries in optics beginning in the mid-1660s
                    and reaching across four decades; and during the course of
                    his 60 years of intense intellectual activity he put no less
                    effort into chemical and alchemical research and into
                    theology and biblical studies than he put into mathematics
                    and physics. He became a dominant figure in Britain almost
                    immediately following publication of his Principia in 1687,
                    with the consequence that “Newtonianism” of one form or
                    another had become firmly rooted there within the first
                    decade of the eighteenth century. His influence on the
                    continent, however, was delayed by the strong opposition to
                    his theory of gravity expressed by such leading figures as
                    Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz, both of whom saw the theory
                    as invoking an occult power of action at a distance in the
                    absence of Newton's having proposed a contact mechanism by
                    means of which forces of gravity could act. As the promise
                    of the theory of gravity became increasingly substantiated,
                    starting in the late 1730s but especially during the 1740s
                    and 1750s, Newton became an equally dominant figure on the
                    continent, and “Newtonianism,” though perhaps in more
                    guarded forms, flourished there as well. What physics
                    textbooks now refer to as “Newtonian mechanics” and
                    “Newtonian science” consists mostly of results achieved on
                    the continent between 1740 and 1800.

                    Newton's life naturally divides into four parts: the years
                    before he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1661; his
                    years in Cambridge before the Principia was published in
                    1687; a period of almost a decade immediately following this
                    publication, marked by the renown it brought him and his
                    increasing disenchantment with Cambridge; and his final
                    three decades in London, for most of which he was Master of
                    the Mint. While he remained intellectually active during his
                    years in London, his legendary advances date almost entirely
                    from his years in Cambridge. Nevertheless, save for his
                    optical papers of the early 1670s and the first edition of
                    the Principia, all his works published before he died fell
                    within his years in London.[1]


                    1.1 Newton's Early Years


                    Newton was born into a Puritan family in Woolsthorpe, a
                    small village in Linconshire near Grantham, on 25 December
                    1642 (old calendar), a few days short of one year after
                    Galileo died. Isaac's father, a farmer, died two months
                    before Isaac was born. When his mother Hannah married the 63
                    year old Barnabas Smith three years later and moved to her
                    new husband's residence, Isaac was left behind with his
                    maternal grandparents. (Isaac learned to read and write from
                    his maternal grandmother and mother, both of whom, unlike
                    his father, were literate.) Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe
                    with three new children in 1653, after Smith died. Two years
                    later Isaac went to boarding school in Grantham, returning
                    full time to manage the farm, not very successfully, in
                    1659. Hannah's brother, who had received an M.A. from
                    Cambridge, and the headmaster of the Grantham school then
                    persuaded his mother that Isaac should prepare for the
                    university. After further schooling at Grantham, he entered
                    Trinity College in 1661, somewhat older than most of his
                    classmates.


                    These years of Newton's youth were the most turbulent in the
                    history of England. The English Civil War had begun in 1642,
                    King Charles was beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell ruled as
                    lord protector from 1653 until he died in 1658, followed by
                    his son Richard from 1658 to 1659, leading to the
                    restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660. How
                    much the political turmoil of these years affected Newton
                    and his family is unclear, but the effect on Cambridge and
                    other universities was substantial, if only through
                    unshackling them for a period from the control of the
                    Anglican Catholic Church. The return of this control with
                    the restoration was a key factor inducing such figures as
                    Robert Boyle to turn to Charles II for support for what in
                    1660 emerged as the Royal Society of London. The
                    intellectual world of England at the time Newton
                    matriculated to Cambridge was thus very different from what
                    it was when he was born.


                    1.2 Newton's Years at Cambridge Prior to Principia


                    Newton's initial education at Cambridge was classical,
                    focusing (primarily through secondary sources) on
                    Aristotlean rhetoric, logic, ethics, and physics. By 1664,
                    Newton had begun reaching beyond the standard curriculum,
                    reading, for example, the 1656 Latin edition of Descartes's
                    Opera philosophica, which included the Meditations,
                    Discourse on Method, the Dioptrics, and the Principles of
                    Philosophy. By early 1664 he had also begun teaching himself
                    mathematics, taking notes on works by Oughtred, Viète,
                    Wallis, and Descartes — the latter via van Schooten's Latin
                    translation, with commentary, of the Géométrie. Newton spent
                    all but three months from the summer of 1665 until the
                    spring of 1667 at home in Woolsthorpe when the university
                    was closed because of the plague. This period was his
                    so-called annus mirabilis. During it, he made his initial
                    experimental discoveries in optics and developed
                    (independently of Huygens's treatment of 1659) the
                    mathematical theory of uniform circular motion, in the
                    process noting the relationship between the inverse-square
                    and Kepler's rule relating the square of the planetary
                    periods to the cube of their mean distance from the Sun.
                    Even more impressively, by late 1666 he had become de facto
                    the leading mathematician in the world, having extended his
                    earlier examination of cutting-edge problems into the
                    discovery of the calculus, as presented in his tract of
                    October 1666. He returned to Trinity as a Fellow in 1667,
                    where he continued his research in optics, constructing his
                    first reflecting telescope in 1669, and wrote a more
                    extended tract on the calculus “De Analysi per Æquations
                    Numero Terminorum Infinitas” incorporating new work on
                    infinite series. On the basis of this tract Isaac Barrow
                    recommended Newton as his replacement as Lucasian Professor
                    of Mathematics, a position he assumed in October 1669, four
                    and a half years after he had received his Bachelor of Arts.


                    Over the course of the next fifteen years as Lucasian
                    Professor Newton presented his lectures and carried on
                    research in a variety of areas. By 1671 he had completed
                    most of a treatise length account of the calculus,[2] which
                    he then found no one would publish. This failure appears to
                    have diverted his interest in mathematics away from the
                    calculus for some time, for the mathematical lectures he
                    registered during this period mostly concern algebra.
                    (During the early 1680s he undertook a critical review of
                    classical texts in geometry, a review that reduced his view
                    of the importance of symbolic mathematics.) His lectures
                    from 1670 to 1672 concerned optics, with a large range of
                    experiments presented in detail. Newton went public with his
                    work in optics in early 1672, submitting material that was
                    read before the Royal Society and then published in the
                    Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. This led to
                    four years of exchanges with various figures who challenged
                    his claims, including both Robert Hooke and Christiaan
                    Huygens — exchanges that at times exasperated Newton to the
                    point that he chose to withdraw from further public
                    exchanges in natural philosophy. Before he largely isolated
                    himself in the late 1670s, however, he had also engaged in a
                    series of sometimes long exchanges in the mid 1670s, most
                    notably with John Collins (who had a copy of “De Analysi”)
                    and Leibniz, concerning his work on the calculus. So, though
                    they remained unpublished, Newton's advances in mathematics
                    scarcely remained a secret.


                    This period as Lucasian Professor also marked the beginning
                    of his more private researches in alchemy and theology.
                    Newton purchased chemical apparatus and treatises in alchemy
                    in 1669, with experiments in chemistry extending across this
                    entire period. The issue of the vows Newton might have to
                    take in conjunction with the Lucasian Professorship also
                    appears to have precipitated his study of the doctrine of
                    the Trinity, which opened the way to his questioning the
                    validity of a good deal more doctrine central to the Roman
                    and Anglican Churches.


                    Newton showed little interest in orbital astronomy during
                    this period until Hooke initiated a brief correspondence
                    with him in an effort to solicit material for the Royal
                    Society at the end of November 1679, shortly after Newton
                    had returned to Cambridge following the death of his mother.
                    Among the several problems Hooke proposed to Newton was the
                    question of the trajectory of a body under an inverse-square
                    central force:


                    It now remaines to know the proprietys of a curve Line (not
                    circular nor concentricall) made by a centrall attractive
                    power which makes the velocitys of Descent from the tangent
                    Line or equall straight motion at all Distances in a
                    Duplicate proportion to the Distances Reciprocally taken. I
                    doubt not but that by your excellent method you will easily
                    find out what the Curve must be, and it proprietys, and
                    suggest a physicall Reason of this proportion.[3]


                    Newton apparently discovered the systematic relationship
                    between conic-section trajectories and inverse-square
                    central forces at the time, but did not communicate it to
                    anyone, and for reasons that remain unclear did not follow
                    up this discovery until Halley, during a visit in the summer
                    of 1684, put the same question to him. His immediate answer
                    was, an ellipse; and when he was unable to produce the paper
                    on which he had made this determination, he agreed to
                    forward an account to Halley in London. Newton fulfilled
                    this commitment in November by sending Halley a
                    nine-folio-page manuscript, “De Motu Corporum in Gyrum” (“On
                    the Motion of Bodies in Orbit”), which was entered into the
                    Register of the Royal Society in early December 1684. The
                    body of this tract consists of ten deduced propositions —
                    three theorems and seven problems — all of which, along with
                    their corollaries, recur in important propositions in the
                    Principia.


                    Save for a few weeks away from Cambridge, from late 1684
                    until early 1687, Newton concentrated on lines of research
                    that expanded the short ten-proposition tract into the 500
                    page Principia, with its 192 derived propositions. Initially
                    the work was to have a two book structure, but Newton
                    subsequently shifted to three books, and replaced the
                    original version of the final book with one more
                    mathematically demanding. The manuscript for Book 1 was sent
                    to London in the spring of 1686, and the manuscripts for
                    Books 2 and 3, in March and April 1687, respectively. The
                    roughly three hundred copies of the Principia came off the
                    press in the summer of 1687, thrusting the 44 year old
                    Newton into the forefront of natural philosophy and forever
                    ending his life of comparative isolation.


                    1.3 Newton's Final Years at Cambridge


                    The years between the publication of the Principia and
                    Newton's permanent move to London in 1696 were marked by his
                    increasing disenchantment with his situation in Cambridge.
                    In January 1689, following the Glorious Revolution at the
                    end of 1688, he was elected to represent Cambridge
                    University in the Convention Parliament, which he did until
                    January 1690. During this time he formed friendships with
                    John Locke and Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, and in the summer
                    of 1689 he finally met Christiaan Huygens face to face for
                    two extended discussions. Perhaps because of disappointment
                    with Huygens not being convinced by the argument for
                    universal gravity, in the early 1690s Newton initiated a
                    radical rewriting of the Principia. During these same years
                    he wrote (but withheld) his principal treatise in alchemy,
                    Praxis; he corresponded with Richard Bentley on religion and
                    allowed Locke to read some of his writings on the subject;
                    he once again entered into an effort to put his work on the
                    calculus in a form suitable for publication; and he carried
                    out experiments on diffraction with the intent of completing
                    his Opticks, only to withhold the manuscript from
                    publication because of dissatisfaction with its treatment of
                    diffraction. The radical revision of the Principia became
                    abandoned by 1693, during the middle of which Newton
                    suffered, by his own testimony, what in more recent times
                    would be called a nervous breakdown. In the two years
                    following his recovery that autumn, he continued his
                    experiments in chymistry and he put substantial effort into
                    trying to refine and extend the gravity-based theory of the
                    lunar orbit in the Principia, but with less success than he
                    had hoped.


                    Throughout these years Newton showed interest in a position
                    of significance in London, but again with less success than
                    he had hoped until he accepted the relatively minor position
                    of Warden of the Mint in early 1696, a position he held
                    until he became Master of the Mint at the end of 1699. He
                    again represented Cambridge University in Parliament for 16
                    months, beginning in 1701, the year in which he resigned his
                    Fellowship at Trinity College and the Lucasian
                    Professorship. He was elected President of the Royal Society
                    in 1703 and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.


                    1.4 Newton's Years in London and His Final Years


                    Newton thus became a figure of imminent authority in London
                    over the rest of his life, in face-to-face contact with
                    individuals of power and importance in ways that he had not
                    known in his Cambridge years. His everyday home life changed
                    no less dramatically when his extraordinarily vivacious
                    teenage niece, Catherine Barton, the daughter of his
                    half-sister Hannah, moved in with him shortly after he moved
                    to London, staying until she married John Conduitt in 1717,
                    and after that remaining in close contact. (It was through
                    her and her husband that Newton's papers came down to
                    posterity.) Catherine was socially prominent among the
                    powerful and celebrated among the literati for the years
                    before she married, and her husband was among the wealthiest
                    men of London.


                    The London years saw Newton embroiled in some nasty
                    disputes, probably made the worse by the ways in which he
                    took advantage of his position of authority in the Royal
                    Society. In the first years of his Presidency he became
                    involved in a dispute with John Flamsteed in which he and
                    Halley, long ill-disposed toward the Flamsteed, violated the
                    trust of the Royal Astronomer, turning him into a permanent
                    enemy. Ill feelings between Newton and Leibniz had been
                    developing below the surface from even before Huygens had
                    died in 1695, and they finally came to a head in 1710 when
                    John Keill accused Leibniz in the Philosophical Transactions
                    of having plagiarized the calculus from Newton and Leibniz,
                    a Fellow of the Royal Society since 1673, demanded redress
                    from the Society. The Society's 1712 published response was
                    anything but redress. Newton not only was a dominant figure
                    in this response, but then published an outspoken anonymous
                    review of it in 1715 in the Philosophical Transactions.
                    Leibniz and his colleagues on the Continent had never been
                    comfortable with the Principia and its implication of action
                    at a distance. With the priority dispute this attitude
                    turned into one of open hostility toward Newton's theory of
                    gravity — a hostility that was matched in its blindness by
                    the fervor of acceptance of the theory in England. The
                    public elements of the priority dispute had the effect of
                    expanding a schism between Newton and Leibniz into a schism
                    between the English associated with the Royal Society and
                    the group who had been working with Leibniz on the calculus
                    since the 1690s, including most notably Johann Bernoulli,
                    and this schism in turn transformed into one between the
                    conduct of science and mathematics in England versus the
                    Continent that persisted long after Leibniz died in 1716.


                    Although Newton obviously had far less time available to
                    devote to solitary research during his London years than he
                    had had in Cambridge, he did not entirely cease to be
                    productive. The first (English) edition of his Opticks
                    finally appeared in 1704, appended to which were two
                    mathematical treatises, his first work on the calculus to
                    appear in print. This edition was followed by a Latin
                    edition in 1706 and a second English edition in 1717, each
                    containing important Queries on key topics in natural
                    philosophy beyond those in its predecessor. Other earlier
                    work in mathematics began to appear in print, including a
                    work on algebra, Arithmetica Universalis, in 1707 and “De
                    Analysi” and a tract on finite differences, “Methodis
                    differentialis” in 1711. The second edition of the
                    Principia, on which Newton had begun work at the age of 66
                    in 1709, was published in 1713, with a third edition in
                    1726. Though the original plan for a radical restructuring
                    had long been abandoned, the fact that virtually every page
                    of the Principia received some modifications in the second
                    edition shows how carefully Newton, often prodded by his
                    editor Roger Cotes, reconsidered everything in it; and
                    important parts were substantially rewritten not only in
                    response to Continental criticisms, but also because of new
                    data, including data from experiments on resistance forces
                    carried out in London. Focused effort on the third edition
                    began in 1723, when Newton was 80 years old, and while the
                    revisions are far less extensive than in the second edition,
                    it does contain substantive additions and modfications, and
                    it surely has claim to being the edition that represents his
                    most considered views.


                    Newton died on 20 March 1727 at the age of 84. His
                    contemporaries' conception of him nevertheless continued to
                    expand as a consequence of various posthumous publications,
                    including The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728);
                    the work originally intended to be the last book of the
                    Principia, The System of the World (1728, in both English
                    and Latin); Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and
                    the Apocalypse of St. John (1733); A Treatise of the Method
                    of Fluxions and Infinite Series (1737); A Dissertation upon
                    the Sacred Cubit of the Jews (1737), and Four Letters from
                    Sir Isaac Newton to Doctor Bentley concerning Some Arguments
                    in Proof of a Deity (1756). Even then, however, the works
                    that had been published represented only a limited fraction
                    of the total body of papers that had been left in the hands
                    of Catherine and John Conduitt. The five volume collection
                    of Newton's works edited by Samuel Horsley (1779–85) did not
                    alter this situation. Through the marriage of the Conduitts'
                    daughter Catherine and subsequent inheritance, this body of
                    papers came into the possession of Lord Portsmouth, who
                    agreed in 1872 to allow it to be reviewed by scholars at
                    Cambridge University (John Couch Adams, George Stokes, H. R.
                    Luard, and G. D. Liveing). They issued a catalogue in 1888,
                    and the university then retained all the papers of a
                    scientific character. With the notable exception of W. W.
                    Rouse Ball, little work was done on the scientific papers
                    before World War II. The remaining papers were returned to
                    Lord Portsmouth, and then ultimately sold at auction in 1936
                    to various parties. Serious scholarly work on them did not
                    get underway until the 1970s, and much remains to be done on
                    them.


                    2. Newton's Work and Influence


                    Three factors stand in the way of giving an account of
                    Newton's work and influence. First is the contrast between
                    the public Newton, consisting of publications in his
                    lifetime and in the decade or two following his death, and
                    the private Newton, consisting of his unpublished work in
                    math and physics, his efforts in chymistry — that is, the
                    17th century blend of alchemy and chemistry — and his
                    writings in radical theology — material that has become
                    public mostly since World War II. Only the public Newton
                    influenced the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
                    yet any account of Newton himself confined to this material
                    can at best be only fragmentary. Second is the contrast,
                    often shocking, between the actual content of Newton's
                    public writings and the positions attributed to him by
                    others, including most importantly his popularizers. The
                    term “Newtonian” refers to several different intellectual
                    strands unfolding in the eighteenth century, some of them
                    tied more closely to Voltaire, Pemberton, and Maclaurin — or
                    for that matter to those who saw themselves as extending his
                    work, such as Clairaut, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and
                    Laplace — than to Newton himself. Third is the contrast
                    between the enormous range of subjects to which Newton
                    devoted his full concentration at one time or another during
                    the 60 years of his intellectual career — mathematics,
                    optics, mechanics, astronomy, experimental chemistry,
                    alchemy, and theology — and the remarkably little
                    information we have about what drove him or his sense of
                    himself. Biographers and analysts who try to piece together
                    a unified picture of Newton and his intellectual endeavors
                    often end up telling us almost as much about themselves as
                    about Newton.


                    Compounding the diversity of the subjects to which Newton
                    devoted time are sharp contrasts in his work within each
                    subject. Optics and orbital mechanics both fall under what
                    we now call physics, and even then they were seen as tied to
                    one another, as indicated by Descartes' first work on the
                    subject, Le Monde, ou Traité de la lumierè. Nevertheless,
                    two very different “Newtonian” traditions in physics arose
                    from Newton's Opticks and Principia: from his Opticks a
                    tradition centered on meticulous experimentation and from
                    his Principia a tradition centered on mathematical theory.
                    The most important element common to these two was Newton's
                    deep commitment to having the empirical world serve not only
                    as the ultimate arbiter, but also as the sole basis for
                    adopting provisional theory. Throughout all of this work he
                    displayed distrust of what was then known as the method of
                    hypotheses – putting forward hypotheses that reach beyond
                    all known phenomena and then testing them by deducing
                    observable conclusions from them. Newton insisted instead on
                    having specific phenomena decide each element of theory,
                    with the goal of limiting the provisional aspect of theory
                    as much as possible to the step of inductively generalizing
                    from the specific phenomena. This stance is perhaps best
                    summarized in his fourth Rule of Reasoning, added in the
                    third edition of the Principia, but adopted as early as his
                    Optical Lectures of the 1670s:


                    In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from
                    phenomena by induction should be taken to be either exactly
                    or very nearly true notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses,
                    until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more
                    exact or liable to exceptions.


                    This rule should be followed so that arguments based on
                    induction may not be nullified by hypotheses.


                    Such a commitment to empirically driven science was a
                    hallmark of the Royal Society from its very beginnings, and
                    one can find it in the research of Kepler, Galileo, Huygens,
                    and in the experimental efforts of the Royal Academy of
                    Paris. Newton, however, carried this commitment further
                    first by eschewing the method of hypotheses and second by
                    displaying in his Principia and Opticks how rich a set of
                    theoretical results can be secured through well-designed
                    experiments and mathematical theory designed to allow
                    inferences from phenomena. The success of those after him in
                    building on these theoretical results completed the process
                    of transforming natural philosophy into modern empirical
                    science.


                    Newton's commitment to having phenomena decide the elements
                    of theory required questions to be left open when no
                    available phenomena could decide them. Newton contrasted
                    himself most strongly with Leibniz in this regard at the end
                    of his anonymous review of the Royal Society's report on the
                    priority dispute over the calculus:


                    It must be allowed that these two Gentlemen differ very much
                    in Philosophy. The one proceeds upon the Evidence arising
                    from Experiments and Phenomena, and stops where such
                    Evidence is wanting; the other is taken up with Hypotheses,
                    and propounds them, not to be examined by Experiments, but
                    to be believed without Examination. The one for want of
                    Experiments to decide the Question, doth not affirm whether
                    the Cause of Gravity be Mechanical or not Mechanical; the
                    other that it is a perpetual Miracle if it be not
                    Mechanical.


                    Newton could have said much the same about the question of
                    what light consists of, waves or particles, for while he
                    felt that the latter was far more probable, he saw it still
                    not decided by any experiment or phenomenon in his lifetime.
                    Leaving questions about the ultimate cause of gravity and
                    the constitution of light open was the other factor in his
                    work driving a wedge between natural philosophy and
                    empirical science.


                    The many other areas of Newton's intellectual endeavors made
                    less of a difference to eighteenth century philosophy and
                    science. In mathematics, Newton was the first to develop a
                    full range of algorithms for symbolically determining what
                    we now call integrals and derivatives, but he subsequently
                    became fundamentally opposed to the idea, championed by
                    Leibniz, of transforming mathematics into a discipline
                    grounded in symbol manipulation. Newton thought the only way
                    of rendering limits rigorous lay in extending geometry to
                    incorporate them, a view that went entirely against the tide
                    in the development of mathematics in the eighteenth and
                    nineteenth ceturies. In chemistry Newton conducted a vast
                    array of experiments, but the experimental tradition coming
                    out of his Opticks, and not his experiments in chemistry,
                    lay behind Lavoisier calling himself a Newtonian; indeed,
                    one must wonder whether Lavoisier would even have associated
                    his new form of chemistry with Newton had he been aware of
                    Newton's fascination with writings in the alchemical
                    tradition. And even in theology, there is Newton the
                    anti-Trinitarian mild heretic who was not that much more
                    radical in his departures from Roman and Anglican
                    Christianity than many others at the time, and Newton, the
                    wild religious zealot predicting the end of the Earth, who
                    did not emerge to public view until quite recently.


                    There is surprisingly little cross-referencing of themes
                    from one area of Newton's endeavors to another. The common
                    element across almost all of them is that of a
                    problem-solver extraordinaire, taking on one problem at a
                    time and staying with it until he had found, usually rather
                    promptly, a solution. All of his technical writings display
                    this, but so too does his unpublished manuscript
                    reconstructing Solomon's Temple from the biblical account of
                    it and his posthumously published Chronology of the Ancient
                    Kingdoms in which he attempted to infer from astronomical
                    phenomena the dating of major events in the Old Testament.
                    The Newton one encounters in his writings seems to
                    compartmentalize his interests at any given moment. Whether
                    he had a unified conception of what he was up to in all his
                    intellectual efforts, and if so what this conception might
                    be, has been a continuing source of controversy among Newton
                    scholars.


                    Of course, were it not for the Principia, there would be no
                    entry at all for Newton in an Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In
                    science, he would have been known only for the contributions
                    he made to optics, which, while notable, were no more so
                    than those made by Huygens and Grimaldi, neither of whom had
                    much impact on philosophy; and in mathematics, his failure
                    to publish would have relegated his work to not much more
                    than a footnote to the achievements of Leibniz and his
                    school. Regardless of which aspect of Newton's endeavors
                    “Newtonian” might be applied to, the word gained its aura
                    from the Principia. But this adds still a further
                    complication, for the Principia itself was substantially
                    different things to different people. The press-run of the
                    first edition (estimated to be around 300) was too small for
                    it to have been read by all that many individuals. The
                    second edition also appeared in two pirated Amsterdam
                    editions, and hence was much more widely available, as was
                    the third edition and its English (and later French)
                    translation. The Principia, however, is not an easy book to
                    read, so one must still ask, even of those who had access to
                    it, whether they read all or only portions of the book and
                    to what extent they grasped the full complexity of what they
                    read. The detailed commentary provided in the three volume
                    Jesuit edition (1739–42) made the work less daunting. But
                    even then the vast majority of those invoking the word
                    “Newtonian” were unlikely to have been much more conversant
                    with the Principia itself than those in the first half of
                    the 20th century who invoked ‘relativity’ were likely to
                    have read Einstein's two special relativity papers of 1905
                    or his general relativity paper of 1916. An important
                    question to ask of any philosophers commenting on Newton is,
                    what primary sources had they read?


                    The 1740s witnessed a major transformation in the standing
                    of the science in the Principia. The Principia itself had
                    left a number of loose-ends, most of them detectable by only
                    highly discerning readers. By 1730, however, some of these
                    loose-ends had been cited in Bernard le Bovier de
                    Fontenelle's elogium for Newton[4] and in John Machin's
                    appendix to the 1729 English translation of the Principia,
                    raising questions about just how secure Newton's theory of
                    gravity was, empirically. The shift on the continent began
                    in the 1730s when Maupertuis convinced the Royal Academy to
                    conduct expeditions to Lapland and Peru to determine whether
                    Newton's claims about the non-spherical shape of the Earth
                    and the variation of surface gravity with latitude are
                    correct. Several of the loose-ends were successfully
                    resolved during the 1740's through such notable advances
                    beyond the Principia as Clairaut's Théorie de la Figure de
                    la Terre; the return of the expedition from Peru;
                    d'Alembert's 1749 rigid-body solution for the wobble of the
                    Earth that produces the precession of the equinoxes;
                    Clairaut's 1749 resolution of the factor of 2 discrepancy
                    between theory and observation in the mean motion of the
                    lunar apogee, glossed over by Newton but emphasized by
                    Machin; and the prize-winning first ever successful
                    description of the motion of the Moon by Tobias Mayer in
                    1753, based on a theory of this motion derived from gravity
                    by Euler in the early 1750s taking advantage of Clairaut's
                    solution for the mean motion of the apogee.


                    Euler was the central figure in turning the three laws of
                    motion put forward by Newton in the Principia into Newtonian
                    mechanics. These three laws, as Newton formulated them,
                    apply to “point-masses,” a term Euler had put forward in his
                    Mechanica of 1736. Most of the effort of eighteenth century
                    mechanics was devoted to solving problems of the motion of
                    rigid bodies, elastic strings and bodies, and fluids, all of
                    which require principles beyond Newton's three laws. From
                    the 1740s on this led to alternative approaches to
                    formulating a general mechanics, employing such different
                    principles as the conservation of vis viva, the principle of
                    least action, and d'Alembert's principle. The “Newtonian”
                    formulation of a general mechanics sprang from Euler's
                    proposal in 1750 that Newton's second law, in an F=ma
                    formulation that appears nowhere in the Principia, could be
                    applied locally within bodies and fluids to yield
                    differential equations for the motions of bodies, elastic
                    and rigid, and fluids. During the 1750s Euler developed his
                    equations for the motion of fluids, and in the 1760s, his
                    equations of rigid-body motion. What we call Newtonian
                    mechanics was accordingly something for which Euler was more
                    responsible than Newton.


                    Although some loose-ends continued to defy resolution until
                    much later in the eighteenth century, by the early 1750s
                    Newton's theory of gravity had become the accepted basis for
                    ongoing research among almost everyone working in orbital
                    astronomy. Clairaut's successful prediction of the month of
                    return of Halley's comet at the end of this decade made a
                    larger segment of the educated public aware of the extent to
                    which empirical grounds for doubting Newton's theory of
                    gravity had largely disappeared. Even so, one must still ask
                    of anyone outside active research in gravitational astronomy
                    just how aware they were of the developments from ongoing
                    efforts when they made their various pronouncements about
                    the standing of the science of the Principia among the
                    community of researchers. The naivety of these
                    pronouncements cuts both ways: on the one hand, they often
                    reflected a bloated view of how secure Newton's theory was
                    at the time, and, on the other, they often underestimated
                    how strong the evidence favoring it had become. The upshot
                    is a need to be attentive to the question of what anyone,
                    even including Newton himself, had in mind when they spoke
                    of the science of the Principia.


                    To view the seventy years of research after Newton died as
                    merely tying up the loose-ends of the Principia or as simply
                    compiling more evidence for his theory of gravity is to miss
                    the whole point. Research predicated on Newton's theory had
                    answered a huge number of questions about the world dating
                    from long before it. The motion of the Moon and the
                    trajectories of comets were two early examples, both of
                    which answered such questions as how one comet differs from
                    another and what details make the Moon's motion so much more
                    complicated than that of the satellites of Jupiter and
                    Saturn. In the 1770s Laplace had developed a proper theory
                    of the tides, reaching far beyond the suggestions Newton had
                    made in the Principia by including the effects of the
                    Earth's rotation and the non-radial components of the
                    gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon, components that
                    dominate the radial component that Newton had singled out.
                    In 1786 Laplace identified a large 900 year fluctuation in
                    the motions of Jupiter and Saturn arising from quite subtle
                    features of their respective orbits. With this discovery,
                    calculation of the motion of the planets from the theory of
                    gravity became the basis for predicting planet positions,
                    with observation serving primarily to identify further
                    forces not yet taken into consideration in the calculation.
                    These advances in our understanding of planetary motion led
                    Laplace to produce the four principal volumes of his Traité
                    de mécanique céleste from 1799 to 1805, a work collecting in
                    one place all the theoretical and empirical results of the
                    research predicated on Newton's Principia. From that time
                    forward, Newtonian science sprang from Laplace's work, not
                    Newton's.


                    The success of the research in celestial mechanics
                    predicated on the Principia was unprecedented. Nothing of
                    comparable scope and accuracy had ever occurred before in
                    empirical research of any kind. That led to a new
                    philosophical question: what was it about the science of the
                    Principia that enabled it to achieve what it did?
                    Philosophers like Locke and Berkeley began asking this
                    question while Newton was still alive, but it gained
                    increasing force as successes piled on one another over the
                    decades after he died. This question had a practical side,
                    as those working in other fields like chemistry pursued
                    comparable success, and others like Hume and Adam Smith
                    aimed for a science of human affairs. It had, of course, a
                    philosophical side, giving rise to the subdiscipline of
                    philosophy of science, starting with Kant and continuing
                    throughout the nineteenth century as other areas of physical
                    science began showing similar signs of success. The
                    Einsteinian revolution in the beginning of the twentieth
                    century, in which Newtonian theory was shown to hold only as
                    a limiting case of the special and general theories of
                    relativity, added a further twist to the question, for now
                    all the successes of Newtonian science, which still remain
                    in place, have to be seen as predicated on a theory that
                    holds only to high approximation in parochial circumstances.


                    The extraordinary character of the Principia gave rise to a
                    still continuing tendency to place great weight on
                    everything Newton said. This, however, was, and still is,
                    easy to carry to excess. One need look no further than Book
                    2 of the Principia to see that Newton had no more claim to
                    being somehow in tune with nature and the truth than any
                    number of his contemporaries. Newton's manuscripts do reveal
                    an exceptional level of attention to detail of phrasing,
                    from which we can rightly conclude that his pronouncements,
                    especially in print, were generally backed by careful,
                    self-critical reflection. But this conclusion does not
                    automatically extend to every statement he ever made. We
                    must constantly be mindful of the possibility of too much
                    weight being placed, then or now, on any pronouncement that
                    stands in relative isolation over his 60 year career; and,
                    to counter the tendency to excess, we should be even more
                    vigilant than usual in not losing sight of the context,
                    circumstantial as well as historical and textual, of both
                    Newton's statements and the eighteenth century reaction to
                    them.

                    Isaac Newton is best know for his theory about the law of
                    gravity, but his “Principia Mathematica” (1686) with its
                    three laws of motion greatly influenced the Enlightenment in
                    Europe. Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac
                    Newton began developing his theories on light, calculus and
                    celestial mechanics while on break from Cambridge
                    University. 


                    Years of research culminated with the 1687 publication of
                    “Principia,” a landmark work that established the universal
                    laws of motion and gravity. Newton’s second major book,
                    “Opticks,” detailed his experiments to determine the
                    properties of light. Also a student of Biblical history and
                    alchemy, the famed scientist served as president of the
                    Royal Society of London and master of England’s Royal Mint
                    until his death in 1727.


                    Isaac Newton: Early Life and Education


                    Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe,
                    Lincolnshire, England. The son of a farmer who died three
                    months before he was born, Newton spent most of his early
                    years with his maternal grandmother after his mother
                    remarried. His education was interrupted by a failed attempt
                    to turn him into a farmer, and he attended the King’s School
                    in Grantham before enrolling at the University of
                    Cambridge’s Trinity College in 1661.


                    Newton studied a classical curriculum at Cambridge, but he
                    became fascinated by the works of modern philosophers such
                    as René Descartes, even devoting a set of notes to his
                    outside readings he titled “Quaestiones Quaedam
                    Philosophicae” (“Certain Philosophical Questions”). When the
                    Great Plague shuttered Cambridge in 1665, Newton returned
                    home and began formulating his theories on calculus, light
                    and color, his farm the setting for the supposed falling
                    apple that inspired his work on gravity.

                    Isaac Newton’s Telescope and Studies on Light


                    Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a minor
                    fellow. He constructed the first reflecting telescope in
                    1668, and the following year he received his Master of Arts
                    degree and took over as Cambridge’s Lucasian Professor of
                    Mathematics. Asked to give a demonstration of his telescope
                    to the Royal Society of London in 1671, he was elected to
                    the Royal Society the following year and published his notes
                    on optics for his peers.


                    Through his experiments with refraction, Newton determined
                    that white light was a composite of all the colors on the
                    spectrum, and he asserted that light was composed of
                    particles instead of waves. His methods drew sharp rebuke
                    from established Society member Robert Hooke, who was
                    unsparing again with Newton’s follow-up paper in 1675. 


                    Known for his temperamental defense of his work, Newton
                    engaged in heated correspondence with Hooke before suffering
                    a nervous breakdown and withdrawing from the public eye in
                    1678. In the following years, he returned to his earlier
                    studies on the forces governing gravity and dabbled in
                    alchemy.


                    Isaac Newton and the Law of Gravity


                    In 1684, English astronomer Edmund Halley paid a visit to
                    the secluded Newton. Upon learning that Newton had
                    mathematically worked out the elliptical paths of celestial
                    bodies, Halley urged him to organize his notes. 


                    The result was the 1687 publication of “Philosophiae
                    Naturalis Principia Mathematica” (Mathematical Principles of
                    Natural Philosophy), which established the three laws of
                    motion and the law of universal gravity. Newton’s three laws
                    of motion state that (1) Every object in a state of uniform
                    motion will remain in that state of motion unless an
                    external force acts on it; (2) Force equals mass times
                    acceleration: F=MA and (3) For every action there is an
                    equal and opposite reaction.


                    “Principia” propelled Newton to stardom in intellectual
                    circles, eventually earning universal acclaim as one of the
                    most important works of modern science. His work was a
                    foundational part of the European Enlightenment.


                    With his newfound influence, Newton opposed the attempts of
                    King James II to reinstitute Catholic teachings at English
                    Universities. King James II was replaced by his protestant
                    daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange as part of
                    the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and Newton was elected to
                    represent Cambridge in Parliament in 1689. 


                    Newton moved to London permanently after being named warden
                    of the Royal Mint in 1696, earning a promotion to master of
                    the Mint three years later. Determined to prove his position
                    wasn’t merely symbolic, Newton moved the pound sterling from
                    the silver to the gold standard and sought to punish
                    counterfeiters.


                    The death of Hooke in 1703 allowed Newton to take over as
                    president of the Royal Society, and the following year he
                    published his second major work, “Opticks.” Composed largely
                    from his earlier notes on the subject, the book detailed
                    Newton’s painstaking experiments with refraction and the
                    color spectrum, closing with his ruminations on such matters
                    as energy and electricity. In 1705, he was knighted by Queen
                    Anne of England.


                    Isaac Newton: Founder of Calculus?


                    Around this time, the debate over Newton’s claims to
                    originating the field of calculus exploded into a nasty
                    dispute. Newton had developed his concept of “fluxions”
                    (differentials) in the mid 1660s to account for celestial
                    orbits, though there was no public record of his work. 


                    In the meantime, German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz
                    formulated his own mathematical theories and published them
                    in 1684. As president of the Royal Society, Newton oversaw
                    an investigation that ruled his work to be the founding
                    basis of the field, but the debate continued even after
                    Leibniz’s death in 1716. Researchers later concluded that
                    both men likely arrived at their conclusions independent of
                    one another.


                    Death of Isaac Newton


                    Newton was also an ardent student of history and religious
                    doctrines, and his writings on those subjects were compiled
                    into multiple books that were published posthumously. Having
                    never married, Newton spent his later years living with his
                    niece at Cranbury Park near Winchester, England. He died in
                    his sleep on March 31, 1727, and was buried in Westminster
                    Abbey.


                    A giant even among the brilliant minds that drove the
                    Scientific Revolution, Newton is remembered as a
                    transformative scholar, inventor and writer. He eradicated
                    any doubts about the heliocentric model of the universe by
                    establishing celestial mechanics, his precise methodology
                    giving birth to what is known as the scientific method.
                    Although his theories of space-time and gravity eventually
                    gave way to those of Albert Einstein, his work remains the
                    bedrock on which modern physics was built.


                    “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders
                    of Giants.”


                    “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the
                    madness of people.”


                    “What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean.”


                    “Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot
                    explain who sets the planets in motion.”


                    “No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess.”

                    Who Was Isaac Newton?


                    Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who developed
                    the principles of modern physics, including the laws of
                    motion and is credited as one of the great minds of the
                    17th-century Scientific Revolution.


                    In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, Philosophiae
                    Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of
                    Natural Philosophy), which has been called the single most
                    influential book on physics. In 1705, he was knighted by
                    Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.


                    Early Life and Family


                    Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe,
                    Lincolnshire, England. Using the "old" Julian calendar,
                    Newton's birth date is sometimes displayed as December 25,
                    1642.


                    Newton was the only son of a prosperous local farmer, also
                    named Isaac, who died three months before he was born. A
                    premature baby born tiny and weak, Newton was not expected
                    to survive.


                    When he was 3 years old, his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton,
                    remarried a well-to-do minister, Barnabas Smith, and went to
                    live with him, leaving young Newton with his maternal
                    grandmother.


                    The experience left an indelible imprint on Newton, later
                    manifesting itself as an acute sense of insecurity. He
                    anxiously obsessed over his published work, defending its
                    merits with irrational behavior.


                    At age 12, Newton was reunited with his mother after her
                    second husband died. She brought along her three small
                    children from her second marriage.


                    Isaac Newton's Education


                    Newton was enrolled at the King's School in Grantham, a town
                    in Lincolnshire, where he lodged with a local apothecary and
                    was introduced to the fascinating world of chemistry.


                    His mother pulled him out of school at age 12. Her plan was
                    to make him a farmer and have him tend the farm. Newton
                    failed miserably, as he found farming monotonous. Newton was
                    soon sent back to King's School to finish his basic
                    education.


                    Perhaps sensing the young man's innate intellectual
                    abilities, his uncle, a graduate of the University of
                    Cambridge's Trinity College, persuaded Newton's mother to
                    have him enter the university. Newton enrolled in a program
                    similar to a work-study in 1661, and subsequently waited on
                    tables and took care of wealthier students' rooms.


                    Scientific Revolution


                    When Newton arrived at Cambridge, the Scientific Revolution
                    of the 17th century was already in full force. The
                    heliocentric view of the universe—theorized by astronomers
                    Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, and later refined
                    by Galileo—was well known in most European academic circles.


                    Philosopher René Descartes had begun to formulate a new
                    concept of nature as an intricate, impersonal and inert
                    machine. Yet, like most universities in Europe, Cambridge
                    was steeped in Aristotelian philosophy and a view of nature
                    resting on a geocentric view of the universe, dealing with
                    nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms.


                    During his first three years at Cambridge, Newton was taught
                    the standard curriculum but was fascinated with the more
                    advanced science. All his spare time was spent reading from
                    the modern philosophers. The result was a less-than-stellar
                    performance, but one that is understandable, given his dual
                    course of study.


                    It was during this time that Newton kept a second set of
                    notes, entitled "Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae"
                    ("Certain Philosophical Questions"). The "Quaestiones"
                    reveal that Newton had discovered the new concept of nature
                    that provided the framework for the Scientific Revolution.
                    Though Newton graduated without honors or distinctions, his
                    efforts won him the title of scholar and four years of
                    financial support for future education.


                    In 1665, the bubonic plague that was ravaging Europe had
                    come to Cambridge, forcing the university to close. After a
                    two-year hiatus, Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and
                    was elected a minor fellow at Trinity College, as he was
                    still not considered a standout scholar.


                    In the ensuing years, his fortune improved. Newton received
                    his Master of Arts degree in 1669, before he was 27. During
                    this time, he came across Nicholas Mercator's published book
                    on methods for dealing with infinite series.


                    Newton quickly wrote a treatise, De Analysi, expounding his
                    own wider-ranging results. He shared this with friend and
                    mentor Isaac Barrow, but didn't include his name as author.


                    In June 1669, Barrow shared the unaccredited manuscript with
                    British mathematician John Collins. In August 1669, Barrow
                    identified its author to Collins as "Mr. Newton ... very
                    young ... but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in
                    these things."


                    Newton's work was brought to the attention of the
                    mathematics community for the first time. Shortly afterward,
                    Barrow resigned his Lucasian professorship at Cambridge, and
                    Newton assumed the chair.


                    Isaac Newton’s Discoveries


                    Newton made discoveries in optics, motion and mathematics.
                    Newton theorized that white light was a composite of all
                    colors of the spectrum, and that light was composed of
                    particles.


                    His momentous book on physics, Principia, contains
                    information on nearly all of the essential concepts of
                    physics except energy, ultimately helping him to explain the
                    laws of motion and the theory of gravity. Along with
                    mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Newton is
                    credited for developing essential theories of calculus.


                    Isaac Newton Inventions


                    Newton's first major public scientific achievement was
                    designing and constructing a reflecting telescope in 1668.
                    As a professor at Cambridge, Newton was required to deliver
                    an annual course of lectures and chose optics as his initial
                    topic. He used his telescope to study optics and help prove
                    his theory of light and color.


                    The Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his
                    reflecting telescope in 1671, and the organization's
                    interest encouraged Newton to publish his notes on light,
                    optics and color in 1672. These notes were later published
                    as part of Newton's Opticks: Or, A treatise of the
                    Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.

                    Sir Isaac Newton contemplates the force of gravity, as the
                    famous story goes, on seeing an apple fall in his orchard,
                    circa 1665.


                    Between 1665 and 1667, Newton returned home from Trinity
                    College to pursue his private study, as school was closed
                    due to the Great Plague. Legend has it that, at this time,
                    Newton experienced his famous inspiration of gravity with
                    the falling apple. According to this common myth, Newton was
                    sitting under an apple tree when a fruit fell and hit him on
                    the head, inspiring him to suddenly come up with the theory
                    of gravity.


                    While there is no evidence that the apple actually hit
                    Newton on the head, he did see an apple fall from a tree,
                    leading him to wonder why it fell straight down and not at
                    an angle. Consequently, he began exploring the theories of
                    motion and gravity.


                    It was during this 18-month hiatus as a student that Newton
                    conceived many of his most important insights—including the
                    method of infinitesimal calculus, the foundations for his
                    theory of light and color, and the laws of planetary
                    motion—that eventually led to the publication of his physics
                    book Principia and his theory of gravity.


                    Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion


                    In 1687, following 18 months of intense and effectively
                    nonstop work, Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis
                    Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural
                    Philosophy), most often known as Principia.


                    Principia is said to be the single most influential book on
                    physics and possibly all of science. Its publication
                    immediately raised Newton to international prominence.


                    Principia offers an exact quantitative description of bodies
                    in motion, with three basic but important laws of motion:


                    A stationary body will stay stationary unless an external
                    force is applied to it.


                    Force is equal to mass times acceleration, and a change in
                    motion (i.e., change in speed) is proportional to the force
                    applied.


                    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.


                    Newton and the Theory of Gravity


                    Newton’s three basic laws of motion outlined in Principia
                    helped him arrive at his theory of gravity. Newton’s law of
                    universal gravitation states that two objects attract each
                    other with a force of gravitational attraction that’s
                    proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to
                    the square of the distance between their centers.


                    These laws helped explain not only elliptical planetary
                    orbits but nearly every other motion in the universe: how
                    the planets are kept in orbit by the pull of the sun’s
                    gravity; how the moon revolves around Earth and the moons of
                    Jupiter revolve around it; and how comets revolve in
                    elliptical orbits around the sun.


                    They also allowed him to calculate the mass of each planet,
                    calculate the flattening of the Earth at the poles and the
                    bulge at the equator, and how the gravitational pull of the
                    sun and moon create the Earth’s tides. In Newton's account,
                    gravity kept the universe balanced, made it work, and
                    brought heaven and Earth together in one great equation.

                    Isaac Newton & Robert Hooke


                    Not everyone at the Royal Academy was enthusiastic about
                    Newton’s discoveries in optics and 1672 publication of
                    Opticks: Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions,
                    Inflections and Colours of Light. Among the dissenters was
                    Robert Hooke, one of the original members of the Royal
                    Academy and a scientist who was accomplished in a number of
                    areas, including mechanics and optics.


                    While Newton theorized that light was composed of particles,
                    Hooke believed it was composed of waves. Hooke quickly
                    condemned Newton's paper in condescending terms, and
                    attacked Newton's methodology and conclusions.


                    Hooke was not the only one to question Newton's work in
                    optics. Renowned Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens and a
                    number of French Jesuits also raised objections. But because
                    of Hooke's association with the Royal Society and his own
                    work in optics, his criticism stung Newton the worst.


                    Unable to handle the critique, he went into a rage—a
                    reaction to criticism that was to continue throughout his
                    life. Newton denied Hooke's charge that his theories had any
                    shortcomings and argued the importance of his discoveries to
                    all of science.


                    In the ensuing months, the exchange between the two men grew
                    more acrimonious, and soon Newton threatened to quit the
                    Royal Society altogether. He remained only when several
                    other members assured him that the Fellows held him in high
                    esteem.


                    The rivalry between Newton and Hooke would continue for
                    several years thereafter. Then, in 1678, Newton suffered a
                    complete nervous breakdown and the correspondence abruptly
                    ended. The death of his mother the following year caused him
                    to become even more isolated, and for six years he withdrew
                    from intellectual exchange except when others initiated
                    correspondence, which he always kept short.


                    During his hiatus from public life, Newton returned to his
                    study of gravitation and its effects on the orbits of
                    planets. Ironically, the impetus that put Newton on the
                    right direction in this study came from Robert Hooke.


                    In a 1679 letter of general correspondence to Royal Society
                    members for contributions, Hooke wrote to Newton and brought
                    up the question of planetary motion, suggesting that a
                    formula involving the inverse squares might explain the
                    attraction between planets and the shape of their orbits.


                    Subsequent exchanges transpired before Newton quickly broke
                    off the correspondence once again. But Hooke's idea was soon
                    incorporated into Newton's work on planetary motion, and
                    from his notes it appears he had quickly drawn his own
                    conclusions by 1680, though he kept his discoveries to
                    himself.


                    In early 1684, in a conversation with fellow Royal Society
                    members Christopher Wren and Edmond Halley, Hooke made his
                    case on the proof for planetary motion. Both Wren and Halley
                    thought he was on to something, but pointed out that a
                    mathematical demonstration was needed.


                    In August 1684, Halley traveled to Cambridge to visit with
                    Newton, who was coming out of his seclusion. Halley idly
                    asked him what shape the orbit of a planet would take if its
                    attraction to the sun followed the inverse square of the
                    distance between them (Hooke's theory).


                    Newton knew the answer, due to his concentrated work for the
                    past six years, and replied, "An ellipse." Newton claimed to
                    have solved the problem some 18 years prior, during his
                    hiatus from Cambridge and the plague, but he was unable to
                    find his notes. Halley persuaded him to work out the problem
                    mathematically and offered to pay all costs so that the
                    ideas might be published, which it was, in Newton’s
                    Principia.


                    Upon the publication of the first edition of Principia in
                    1687, Robert Hooke immediately accused Newton of plagiarism,
                    claiming that he had discovered the theory of inverse
                    squares and that Newton had stolen his work. The charge was
                    unfounded, as most scientists knew, for Hooke had only
                    theorized on the idea and had never brought it to any level
                    of proof.


                    Newton, however, was furious and strongly defended his
                    discoveries. He withdrew all references to Hooke in his
                    notes and threatened to withdraw from publishing the
                    subsequent edition of Principia altogether.


                    Halley, who had invested much of himself in Newton's work,
                    tried to make peace between the two men. While Newton
                    begrudgingly agreed to insert a joint acknowledgment of
                    Hooke's work (shared with Wren and Halley) in his discussion
                    of the law of inverse squares, it did nothing to placate
                    Hooke.


                    As the years went on, Hooke's life began to unravel. His
                    beloved niece and companion died the same year that
                    Principia was published, in 1687. As Newton's reputation and
                    fame grew, Hooke's declined, causing him to become even more
                    bitter and loathsome toward his rival.


                    To the very end, Hooke took every opportunity he could to
                    offend Newton. Knowing that his rival would soon be elected
                    president of the Royal Society, Hooke refused to retire
                    until the year of his death, in 1703.


                    Following the publication of Principia, Newton was ready for
                    a new direction in life. He no longer found contentment in
                    his position at Cambridge and was becoming more involved in
                    other issues.


                    He helped lead the resistance to King James II's attempts to
                    reinstitute Catholic teaching at Cambridge, and in 1689 he
                    was elected to represent Cambridge in Parliament.


                    While in London, Newton acquainted himself with a broader
                    group of intellectuals and became acquainted with political
                    philosopher John Locke. Though many of the scientists on the
                    continent continued to teach the mechanical world according
                    to Aristotle, a young generation of British scientists
                    became captivated with Newton's new view of the physical
                    world and recognized him as their leader.


                    One of these admirers was Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss
                    mathematician whom Newton befriended while in London.


                    However, within a few years, Newton fell into another
                    nervous breakdown in 1693. The cause is open to speculation:
                    his disappointment over not being appointed to a higher
                    position by England's new monarchs, William III and Mary II,
                    or the subsequent loss of his friendship with Duillier;
                    exhaustion from being overworked; or perhaps chronic mercury
                    poisoning after decades of alchemical research.


                    It's difficult to know the exact cause, but evidence
                    suggests that letters written by Newton to several of his
                    London acquaintances and friends, including Duillier, seemed
                    deranged and paranoiac, and accused them of betrayal and
                    conspiracy.


                    Oddly enough, Newton recovered quickly, wrote letters of
                    apology to friends, and was back to work within a few
                    months. He emerged with all his intellectual facilities
                    intact, but seemed to have lost interest in scientific
                    problems and now favored pursuing prophecy and scripture and
                    the study of alchemy.


                    While some might see this as work beneath the man who had
                    revolutionized science, it might be more properly attributed
                    to Newton responding to the issues of the time in turbulent
                    17th century Britain.


                    Many intellectuals were grappling with the meaning of many
                    different subjects, not least of which were religion,
                    politics and the very purpose of life. Modern science was
                    still so new that no one knew for sure how it measured up
                    against older philosophies.


                    In 1696, Newton was able to attain the governmental position
                    he had long sought: warden of the Mint; after acquiring this
                    new title, he permanently moved to London and lived with his
                    niece, Catherine Barton.


                    Barton was the mistress of Lord Halifax, a high-ranking
                    government official who was instrumental in having Newton
                    promoted, in 1699, to master of the Mint—a position that he
                    would hold until his death.


                    Not wanting it to be considered a mere honorary position,
                    Newton approached the job in earnest, reforming the currency
                    and severely punishing counterfeiters. As master of the
                    Mint, Newton moved the British currency, the pound sterling,
                    from the silver to the gold standard.


                    In 1703, Newton was elected president of the Royal Society
                    upon Robert Hooke's death. However, Newton never seemed to
                    understand the notion of science as a cooperative venture,
                    and his ambition and fierce defense of his own discoveries
                    continued to lead him from one conflict to another with
                    other scientists.


                    By most accounts, Newton's tenure at the society was
                    tyrannical and autocratic; he was able to control the lives
                    and careers of younger scientists with absolute power.


                    In 1705, in a controversy that had been brewing for several
                    years, German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz publicly
                    accused Newton of plagiarizing his research, claiming he had
                    discovered infinitesimal calculus several years before the
                    publication of Principia.


                    In 1712, the Royal Society appointed a committee to
                    investigate the matter. Of course, since Newton was
                    president of the society, he was able to appoint the
                    committee's members and oversee its investigation. Not
                    surprisingly, the committee concluded Newton's priority over
                    the discovery.


                    That same year, in another of Newton's more flagrant
                    episodes of tyranny, he published without permission the
                    notes of astronomer John Flamsteed. It seems the astronomer
                    had collected a massive body of data from his years at the
                    Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England.


                    Newton had requested a large volume of Flamsteed's notes for
                    his revisions to Principia. Annoyed when Flamsteed wouldn't
                    provide him with more information as quickly as he wanted
                    it, Newton used his influence as president of the Royal
                    Society to be named the chairman of the body of "visitors"
                    responsible for the Royal Observatory.


                    He then tried to force the immediate publication of
                    Flamsteed's catalogue of the stars, as well as all of
                    Flamsteed's notes, edited and unedited. To add insult to
                    injury, Newton arranged for Flamsteed's mortal enemy, Edmund
                    Halley, to prepare the notes for press.


                    Flamsteed was finally able to get a court order forcing
                    Newton to cease his plans for publication and return the
                    notes—one of the few times that Newton was bested by one of
                    his rivals.


                    Toward the end of this life, Newton lived at Cranbury Park,
                    near Winchester, England, with his niece, Catherine (Barton)
                    Conduitt, and her husband, John Conduitt.


                    By this time, Newton had become one of the most famous men
                    in Europe. His scientific discoveries were unchallenged. He
                    also had become wealthy, investing his sizable income wisely
                    and bestowing sizable gifts to charity.


                    Despite his fame, Newton's life was far from perfect: He
                    never married or made many friends, and in his later years,
                    a combination of pride, insecurity and side trips on
                    peculiar scientific inquiries led even some of his few
                    friends to worry about his mental stability.


                    By the time he reached 80 years of age, Newton was
                    experiencing digestion problems and had to drastically
                    change his diet and mobility.


                    In March 1727, Newton experienced severe pain in his abdomen
                    and blacked out, never to regain consciousness. He died the
                    next day, on March 31, 1727, at the age of 84.


                    Newton's fame grew even more after his death, as many of his
                    contemporaries proclaimed him the greatest genius who ever
                    lived. Maybe a slight exaggeration, but his discoveries had
                    a large impact on Western thought, leading to comparisons to
                    the likes of Plato, Aristotle and Galileo.


                    Although his discoveries were among many made during the
                    Scientific Revolution, Newton's universal principles of
                    gravity found no parallels in science at the time.


                    Of course, Newton was proven wrong on some of his key
                    assumptions. In the 20th century, Albert Einstein would
                    overturn Newton's concept of the universe, stating that
                    space, distance and motion were not absolute but relative
                    and that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had
                    ever conceived.


                    Newton might not have been surprised: In his later life,
                    when asked for an assessment of his achievements, he
                    replied, "I do not know what I may appear to the world; but
                    to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the
                    seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a
                    smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the
                    great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."

                    Best Known For: Isaac Newton was an English physicist and
                    mathematician famous for his laws of physics. He was a key
                    figure in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.

                    Isaac Newton helped develop the principles of modern
                    physics, including the laws of motion, and is credited as
                    one of the great minds of the 17th-century Scientific
                    Revolution.


                    In 1687, Newton published his most acclaimed work,
                    'Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'
                    ('Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'), which has
                    been called the single most influential book on physics.


                    Newton's theory of gravity states that two objects attract
                    each other with a force of gravitational attraction that’s
                    proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to
                    the square of the distance between their centers.

                    I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself
                    I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore,
                    and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother
                    pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great
                    ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


                    Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest
                    friend is truth.


                    If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of
                    giants.


                    It is the perfection of God's works that they are all done
                    with the greatest simplicity.


                    Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform
                    motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change
                    that state by forces impressed upon it.


                    To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction:
                    or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are
                    always equal, and directed to contrary parts.


                    I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy.


                    The changing of bodies into light, and light into bodies, is
                    very conformable to the course of nature, which seems
                    delighted with transmutations.


                    To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one
                    man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little
                    with certainty and leave the rest for others that come
                    after, then to explain all things by conjecture without
                    making sure of any thing.


                    Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the
                    multiplicity and confusion of things.


                    Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never
                    had many professors.


                    Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the
                    last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and
                    Sumerians, the last great mind that looked out on the
                    visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those
                    who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less
                    than 10,000 years ago.

                    Isaac Newton was born Jan. 4, 1643. It used to be that we
                    celebrated Newton’s birthday on Dec. 25, for his own birth

                    Scientist of the Day - Isaac Newton


                    Isaac Newton was born Jan. 4, 1643. It used to be that we
                    celebrated Newton’s birthday on Dec. 25, for his own birth
                    records attest that he came into the world on Christmas Day,
                    1642. But the Julian calendar in use in England at the time
                    of Newton’s birth was 10 days behind the Gregorian calendar
                    that had been adopted by most of the Continent, so if you
                    had asked Christiaan Huygens or Pierre Fermat for Newton’s
                    birthday, they would have said Jan. 4, 1643. The generally
                    accepted practice among historians today is to convert all
                    Julian dates between 1582 (when the Gregorian calendar was
                    first implemented) and 1752 (when England finally adopted
                    the “new style” calendar) to Gregorian dates, and we have
                    done so here.


                    Nearly everyone has heard of Isaac Newton and knows that he
                    “discovered gravity”. What Newton actually proposed is the
                    existence of a universal force of gravitation, so that any
                    two objects in the universe are attracted to one another by
                    a force that increases with the product of the masses of the
                    two objects, and decreases with the square of the distance
                    between them. With this force, Newton was able to explain:
                    the rate at which an apple falls, the orbits of the moon and
                    planets, the swing of a pendulum, the ebb and flow of the
                    tides, and even the shape of the earth. Even though Newton
                    did not know how this force acted at a distance, its
                    explanatory power was so great that universal gravitation
                    was almost universally adopted within twenty-five years of
                    his death in 1727.


                    Newton’s equation for the force of gravitation, and his
                    famous “laws of motion”, first appeared in his Mathematical
                    Principles of Natural Philosophy (1687), usually referred to
                    as the Principia, after the third word of the Latin title.
                    We have nearly every edition of the Principia ever
                    published, including the first, in our History of Science
                    Collection. The first English translation of 1729 includes a
                    frontispiece that not only deifies Newton, but nicely
                    represents the solar system as bound together by
                    gravitational forces (third image).


                    The copy of the 1687 Principia shown above (second image) is
                    not our copy, but rather Newton’s own corrected copy, in the
                    Cambridge University Library.

The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.",

If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.\n\nWe will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.',

                  US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter
                  is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and
                  Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No
                  Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                  It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the
                  Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity
                  debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                  1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very
                  best years.

                  Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and
                  young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own
                  chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction
                  reached a great level of popularity during the past decade,
                  the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                  completely different level as they really dominated the
                  business for a few years all over the world, including in some
                  countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                  Western artists.


                  We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this
                  new article with final results which will more than surprise
                  many readers.

                  Was the teen group led by Justin Timberlake really that big?
                  Was it only in the US where they found success? Or were they a
                  global phenomenon?

                  As usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity
                  Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This
                  concept will not only bring you sales information for all
                  NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as
                  audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their
                  true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC
                  method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully
                  recommend watching the video before getting into the sales
                  figures.

                Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at the
                turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive album sales
                across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart-topping
                releases, hyped tours, and tremendous media coverage. NSync also
                had huge sales, with their album No Strings Attached selling 2.4
                million units in its first week. They also had the second
                fastest-selling album of the Soundscan era before 2015, with
                Celebrity debuting at 1.88 million units sold.


                While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two bands was
                more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success in some countries
                that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                    CSPC: Backstreet Boys Popularity Analysis

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive
                    albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                    of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous
                    media coverage.


                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good
                    market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time
                    record year for the music business, as far as revenues in
                    billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is,
                    back when this five men group was at its peak.

                    The `SYSTEM` role is also used for the contents of the optional `chat_history=` parameter. When used with the `chat_history=` parameter it adds content throughout a conversation. Conversely, when used with the `preamble=` parameter it adds content at the start of the conversation only.

                    Each item represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

                    The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "AUTO", some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` will be dropped in an attempt to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be changed and ranked by relevance.

During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be preserved as they are inputted into the API.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "OFF", no elements will be dropped. If the sum of the inputs exceeds the model's context length limit, a `TooManyTokens` error will be returned.

                documents:
                  description: |
                    A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is a string-string dictionary.

                    Example:
                    ```
                    [
                      { "title": "Tall penguins", "text": "Emperor penguins are the tallest." },
                      { "title": "Penguin habitats", "text": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica." },
                    ]
                    ```

                    Keys and values from each document will be serialized to a string and passed to the model. The resulting generation will include citations that reference some of these documents.

                    Some suggested keys are "text", "author", and "date". For better generation quality, it is recommended to keep the total word count of the strings in the dictionary to under 300 words.

                    An `id` field (string) can be optionally supplied to identify the document in the citations. This field will not be passed to the model.

                    An `_excludes` field (array of strings) can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields will still show up in the citation object. The "_excludes" field will not be passed to the model.

                    See ['Document Mode'](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) in the guide for more information.

        Generates a text response to a user message and streams it down, token by token. To learn how to use the Chat API with streaming follow our [Text Generation guides](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/chat-api).

        Follow the [Migration Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/migrating-v1-to-v2) for instructions on moving from API v1 to API v2.

                    When `true`, the response will be a SSE stream of events.

                    Streaming is beneficial for user interfaces that render the contents of the response piece by piece, as it gets generated.

                  description: |
                    Used to control whether or not the model will be forced to use a tool when answering. When `REQUIRED` is specified, the model will be forced to use at least one of the user-defined tools, and the `tools` parameter must be passed in the request.
                    When `NONE` is specified, the model will be forced **not** to use one of the specified tools, and give a direct response.
                    If tool_choice isn't specified, then the model is free to choose whether to use the specified tools or not.

                    **Note**: This parameter is only compatible with models [Command-r7b](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/command-r7b) and newer.

                    **Note**: The same functionality can be achieved in `/v1/chat` using the `force_single_step` parameter. If `force_single_step=true`, this is equivalent to specifying `REQUIRED`. While if `force_single_step=true` and `tool_results` are passed, this is equivalent to specifying `NONE`.

                    text: "LLMs stand for Large Language Models, which are a type of neural network
                      model specialized in processing and generating human
                      language. They are designed to understand and respond to
                      natural language input and have become increasingly
                      popular and valuable in recent years.


                      LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling
                      them to learn patterns, grammar, and semantic meanings
                      present in the language. These models can then be used for
                      various natural language processing tasks, such as text
                      generation, summarization, question answering, machine
                      translation, sentiment analysis, and even some aspects of
                      natural language understanding.


                      Some well-known examples of LLMs include:


                      1. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) — An
                      open-source LLM developed by OpenAI, capable of generating
                      human-like text and performing various language tasks.


                      2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
                      Transformers) — A Google-developed LLM that is
                      particularly good at understanding contextual
                      relationships in text, and is widely used for natural
                      language understanding tasks like sentiment analysis and
                      named entity recognition.


                      3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) — Also from
                      Google, T5 is a flexible LLM that frames all language
                      tasks as text-to-text problems, where the model learns to
                      generate output text based on input text prompts.


                      4. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) — A variant
                      of BERT that uses additional training techniques to
                      improve performance.


                      5. DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled
                      attention) — Another variant of BERT that introduces a new
                      attention mechanism.


                      LLMs have become increasingly powerful and larger in
                      scale, improving the accuracy and sophistication of
                      language tasks. They are also being used as a foundation
                      for developing various applications, including chatbots,
                      content recommendation systems, language translation
                      services, and more.

                      The future of LLMs holds the potential for even more
                      sophisticated language technologies, with ongoing research
                      and development focused on enhancing their capabilities,
                      improving efficiency, and exploring their applications in
                      various domains."

                    At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive
                    albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                    of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous
                    media coverage.


                    It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good
                    market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time
                    record year for the music business, as far as revenues in
                    billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is,
                    back when this five men group was at its peak.

                    At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in
                    the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The
                    latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15
                    years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units
                    sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                    It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of
                    the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since
                    Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                    best years.

                    Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and
                    young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own
                    chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction
                    reached a great level of popularity during the past decade,
                    the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                    completely different level as they really dominated the
                    business for a few years all over the world, including in
                    some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                    Western artists.


                    We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this
                    new article with final results which will more than surprise
                    many readers.

                    Was the teen group led by Justin Timberlake really that big?
                    Was it only in the US where they found success? Or were they
                    a global phenomenon?

                    As usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity
                    Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This
                    concept will not only bring you sales information for all
                    NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as
                    audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their
                    true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC
                    method, the next page explains it with a short video. I
                    fully recommend watching the video before getting into the
                    sales figures.

                      Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at
                      the turn of the millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive
                      album sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty
                      of chart-topping releases, hyped tours, and tremendous
                      media coverage. NSync also had huge sales, with their
                      album No Strings Attached selling 2.4 million units in its
                      first week. They also had the second fastest-selling album
                      of the Soundscan era before 2015, with Celebrity debuting
                      at 1.88 million units sold.


                      While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two
                      bands was more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success
                      in some countries that were traditionally hard to
                      penetrate for Western artists.

                            At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were
                            huge in the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears
                            and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we haven’t

                    text: success in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for
                      Western artists.

                            1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of
                            the very best years.

                            Yet the way many music consumers – especially
                            teenagers and young women’s – embraced their output
                            deserves its own chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more
                            recently One Direction reached a great level of
                            popularity during the past decade, the type of
                            success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a
                            completely different level as they really dominated
                            the business for a few years all over the world,
                            including in some countries that were traditionally
                            hard to penetrate for Western artists.


                            We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony
                            with this new article with final results which will
                            more than surprise many readers.

                    LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a type of neural
                    network-based AI model that has been trained on massive
                    amounts of text data and have become ubiquitous in the AI
                    landscape. They possess astounding capabilities for
                    comprehending and generating human-like language.

                    These models leverage neural networks that operate on a
                    large scale, often involving millions or even billions of
                    parameters. This substantial scale enables them to capture
                    intricate patterns and connections within the vast amounts
                    of text they have been trained on.


                    The training process for LLMs is fueled by colossal datasets
                    of textual information, ranging from books and articles to
                    websites and conversational transcripts. This extensive
                    training enables them to develop a nuanced understanding of
                    language patterns, grammar, and semantics.


                    When posed with a new text input, LLMs employ their finely
                    honed understanding of language to generate informed
                    responses or undertake tasks such as language translation,
                    text completion, or question answering. They do this by
                    manipulating the input text through adding, removing, or
                    altering elements to craft a desired output.


                    One of the underlying principles of their efficacy is the
                    recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture they often
                    adopt. This design enables them to process sequential data
                    like natural language effectively. RNNs possess "memory"
                    aspects via loops between layers, which allows them to
                    retain and manipulate information gathered across long
                    sequences, akin to the way humans process information.


                    However, it's their size that arguably constitutes their
                    most notable aspect. The sheer volume of these models – with
                    counts of parameters often exceeding 100 million – enables
                    them to capture correlations and patterns within language
                    data effectively. This empowers them to generate coherent
                    and contextually appropriate responses, posing a remarkable
                    advancement in conversational AI.


                    While LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary language prowess,
                    it's vital to acknowledge their limitations and potential
                    for improvement. Their biases often reflect those of the
                    training data, and they may struggle with logical
                    inconsistencies or factual errors. Ongoing research aims to
                    enhance their robustness, diversity, and overall usability.


                    In essence, LLMs are a groundbreaking manifestation of AI's
                    potential to simulate and even extend human language
                    capabilities, while also serving as a testament to the
                    ongoing journey towards refining and perfecting these
                    technologies.

                    If `NONE` is selected, when the input exceeds the maximum input token length an error will be returned.

        This endpoint returns text and image embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the content that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).

                    Passing `START` will discard the start of the input. `END` will discard the end of the input. In both cases, input is discarded until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.

                    If `NONE` is selected, when the input exceeds the maximum input token length an error will be returned.

        This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create text classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/semantic-search).

                    Passing `START` will discard the start of the input. `END` will discard the end of the input. In both cases, input is discarded until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.

                    If `NONE` is selected, when the input exceeds the maximum input token length an error will be returned.

                    A list of up to 96 texts to be classified. Each one must be a non-empty string.
                    There is, however, no consistent, universal limit to the length a particular input can be. We perform classification on the first `x` tokens of each input, and `x` varies depending on which underlying model is powering classification. The maximum token length for each model is listed in the "max tokens" column [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).
                    Note: by default the `truncate` parameter is set to `END`, so tokens exceeding the limit will be automatically dropped. This behavior can be disabled by setting `truncate` to `NONE`, which will result in validation errors for longer texts.

                    An array of examples to provide context to the model. Each example is a text string and its associated label/class. Each unique label requires at least 2 examples associated with it; the maximum number of examples is 2500, and each example has a maximum length of 512 tokens. The values should be structured as `{text: "...",label: "..."}`.

              summary: Ice cream is a frozen dessert made by whipping a cream base and liquid
                nitrogen together. It is then flavoured with sweeteners, spices
                and fruits. Ice cream can also be made using alternative milks,
                such as soy or almond, for those who are lactose intolerant or
                vegan.

        Configuration for forcing the model output to adhere to the specified format. Supported on [Command R 03-2024](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r), [Command R+ 04-2024](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus) and newer models.

        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects (with up to 5 levels of nesting) by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.
        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported in RAG mode (when any of `connectors`, `documents`, `tools`, `tool_results` are provided).

        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.

        **Note**: When `json_schema` is not specified, the generated object can have up to 5 layers of nesting.

        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported when used in combinations with the `documents` or `tools` parameters.
