  description: "# Introduction\n Weaviate is an open source, AI-native vector database that helps developers create intuitive and reliable AI-powered applications. \n ### Base Path \nThe base path for the Weaviate server is structured as `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]:[PORT]/v1`. As an example, if you wish to access the `schema` endpoint on a local instance, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8080/v1/schema`. Ensure you replace `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]` and `[PORT]` with your actual server host and port number respectively. \n ### Questions? \nIf you have any comments or questions, please feel free to reach out to us at the community forum [https://forum.weaviate.io/](https://forum.weaviate.io/). \n### Issues? \nIf you find a bug or want to file a feature request, please open an issue on our GitHub repository for [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate). \n### Want more documentation? \nFor a quickstart, code examples, concepts and more, please visit our [documentation page](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate)."

For updating, `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE` and also `OFFLOADED` - as INACTIVE, but files are stored on cloud storage. The following values are read-only and are set by the server for internal use: `OFFLOADING` - tenant is transitioning from ACTIVE/INACTIVE to OFFLOADED, `ONLOADING` - tenant is transitioning from OFFLOADED to ACTIVE/INACTIVE.
