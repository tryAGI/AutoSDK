        /// Delete an object based on its collection and UUID. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: For backward compatibility, beacons also support an older, deprecated format without the collection name. As a result, when deleting a reference, the beacon specified has to match the beacon to be deleted exactly. In other words, if a beacon is present using the old format (without collection name) you also need to specify it the same way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beacon format, you need to always use `localhost` as the host, rather than the actual hostname. `localhost` here refers to the fact that the beacon's target is on the same Weaviate instance, as opposed to a foreign instance.
