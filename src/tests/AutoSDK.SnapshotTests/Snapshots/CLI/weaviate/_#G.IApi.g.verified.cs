    /// # Introduction<br/>
    ///  Weaviate is an open source, AI-native vector database that helps developers create intuitive and reliable AI-powered applications. <br/>
    ///  ### Base Path <br/>
    /// The base path for the Weaviate server is structured as `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]:[PORT]/v1`. As an example, if you wish to access the `schema` endpoint on a local instance, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8080/v1/schema`. Ensure you replace `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]` and `[PORT]` with your actual server host and port number respectively. <br/>
