For a commit signature to be verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be written to the object database. To pass a `signature` parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier to [use the command line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to create signed commits.
