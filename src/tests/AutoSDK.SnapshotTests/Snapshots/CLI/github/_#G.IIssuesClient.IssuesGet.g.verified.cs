For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.<br/>
