        /// 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.<br/>

        /// To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.<br/>
        /// To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.<br/>
        /// Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.<br/>
        /// Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,<br/>
        /// delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.<br/>
        /// Then repeat the process for the second set.<br/>
        /// The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:<br/>
        /// **Outer loop**:<br/>
        /// * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.<br/>
        /// * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:<br/>
        ///   **Inner loop**:<br/>
        ///   * Delete the identified analysis.<br/>
        ///   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.<br/>
        /// The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.<br/>
