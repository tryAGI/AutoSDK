    /// A list of request_id of the samples that come after this generation. next_request_ids is especially useful for maintaining the speech's continuity when regenerating a sample that has had some audio quality issues. For example, if you have generated 3 speech clips, and you want to improve clip 2, passing the request id of clip 3 as a next_request_id (and that of clip 1 as a previous_request_id) will help maintain natural flow in the combined speech. The results will be best when the same model is used across the generations. In case both next_text and next_request_ids is send, next_text will be ignored. A maximum of 3 request_ids can be send.
